<hr class='c002'>

<p class='c011'>The greater part of this volume consists of a diary
jotted down in presence of the scenes described, so as
to preserve for the reader, as far as possible, the freshness
of first impressions, and invest the whole with an
atmosphere of human interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>The route taken may be thus shortly indicated:
Thorshavn; Portland Huk; the Westmanna Islands;
Reykjavik; the Geysers; then, by sea, round the south
coast of the island, with its magnificent Jökul-range of
volcanoes; along the east coast, with its picturesque
Fiords, as far north as Seydisfiord; and thence home
again, by the Faröe Isles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The aim, throughout, has been both to present
pictures and condense information on matters relating
to Faröe and Iceland. In obtaining the latter I have
had the advantages of frequent intercourse with Icelanders,
both personal and by letter, since my visit to the
North in the summer of 1859, and would here mention,
in particular, the Rev. Olaf Pálsson, Dean and Rector
of Reykjavik Cathedral; Mr. Jón Arnason, Secretary
to the Bishop, and Librarian; Mr. Gísli Brynjúlfsson,
the Icelandic poet and M.P.; Mr. Sigurdur Sivertsen, a
retired merchant, and Mr. Jacobson.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so too with the Faröese.</p>

<p class='c011'>I acknowledge obligations to Dr. David Mackinlay of
Glasgow, Dr. Lauder Lindsay of Perth, and several
other friends who have visited Iceland and rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>me assistance of various kinds. Thanks are also due to
Mr. P. L. Henderson, for transmitting, by the <i>Arcturus</i>,
letters, books and newspapers to and from the north.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'><a href='#ap0'>Appendix</a></span> comprises thirteen Icelandic stories
and fairy tales translated by the Rev. Olaf Pálsson;
specimens of old Icelandic poetry; poems on northern
subjects in English and Icelandic; information for intending
tourists; a glossary; and lastly, a chapter on
our Scandinavian ancestors—treating of race, history,
characteristics, language and tendencies. This paper,
originally intended for an introduction, may be perused
either first or last, at the option of the reader. There
is also a copious <span class='sc'><a href='#ap7'>Index</a></span> to the volume.</p>

<p class='c011'>The illustrations, engraved by Mr. W. J. Linton, are
all from original drawings by the writer, with the exception
of half a dozen,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> taken from plates in the large
French folio which contains the account of Gaimard’s
Expedition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Should these pages induce photographers and other
artists to visit this strange trahytic island resting on an
ocean of fire in the lone North Sea, or students to become
familiar with its stirring history and grand old literature,
I shall feel solaced, under a feeling almost akin to regret,
that this self-imposed task—which, in spite of
sundry vexatious delays and interruptions, has afforded
me much true enjoyment—should at length have come
to an end.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'>Can Iceland—that distant island of the North Sea,
that land of Eddas and Sagas, of lava-wastes, snow-jökuls,
volcanoes, and boiling geysers—be visited during
a summer’s holiday? This was the question which for
years I had vaguely proposed to myself. Now I wished
definitely to ascertain particulars, and, if at all practicable,
to accomplish such a journey during the present
season.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Three ways presented themselves—the chance of
getting north in a private yacht—to charter a sloop
from Lerwick—or to take the mail-steamer from Copenhagen.
The first way seemed very doubtful; I was
dissuaded from the second by the great uncertainty as to
when one might get back, and the earnest entreaties of
friends, who, with long faces, insinuated that these wild
northern seas were not to be trifled with. However, the
uncertainty as to time, and the expense, which for one
person would have been considerable, weighed more with
me than any idea of danger. Of the mail-steamer it
was difficult to obtain any information.</p>

<p class='c011'>One morning, when in this dilemma, my eye fell on
an advertisement in the <i>Times</i>, headed “Steam to
Iceland,” informing all whom it might concern that the
Danish mail-steamer “Arcturus,” would, about the 20th
of July, touch at Leith on its way north, affording
passengers a week to visit the interior of the island, and
would return to Leith within a month. I subsequently
ascertained that it was to call at the Faröe and
Westmanna Isles, and that it would also sail from
Reykjavik round to Seydisfiord, on the east of Iceland,
so that one might obtain a view of the magnificent range
of jökuls and numerous glaciers along the south coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day of sailing was a fortnight earlier than I could
have desired, but such an opportunity was not to be
missed. Providing myself with a long waterproof overcoat,
overboots of the same material—both absolutely
essential for riding with any degree of comfort in Iceland,
to protect from lashing rains, and when splashing
through mud-puddles or deep river fordings—getting
together a supply of preserved meats, soups, &#38;c. in tin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>cans, a mariner’s compass, thermometer, one of De La
Rue’s solid sketch-books, files of newspapers, a few
articles for presents, and other needful things, my traps
were speedily put up; and, on Wednesday the 20th of
July, I found myself on board the “Arcturus” in Leith
dock.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a Clyde-built screw-steamer, of 400 tons burden.
Captain Andriessen, a Dane, received me kindly; the
crew, with the exception of the engineer, a Scotchman,
were all foreigners. In the first cabin were eight fellow-passengers,
strangers to each other; but, as is usual at
sea, acquaintanceships were soon formed; by degrees we
came to know each other, and all got along very
pleasantly together.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was only one lady passenger, to whom I was
introduced, Miss Löbner, daughter of the late governor
of Faröe, who had been south, visiting friends in
Edinburgh. Afraid of being ill, she speedily disappeared,
and did not leave her cabin till we reached Thorshavn.
Of our number were Professor Chadbourne, of William’s
College, Massachusetts, and Bowdoin College, Maine,
U.S.; Capt. Forbes, R.N.; Mr. Haycock, a gentleman
from Norfolk, who had recently visited Norway in his
yacht; Mr. Cleghorn, lately an officer in the Indian
army; Mr. Douglas Murray, an intelligent Scottish
farmer, from the neighbourhood of Haddington, taking
his annual holiday; Dr. Livingston, an American M.D.;
and Capt. B——, a Danish artillery officer, <i>en route</i>
from Copenhagen to Reykjavik.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were also several passengers in the second cabin,
some of whom were students returning home from their
studies in the Danish universities.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>There was a large boat to be got on board, for discharging
the steamer’s cargo at Iceland, which took
several hours to get fastened aloft on the right side of
the hurricane deck—with the comfortable prospect of
its top-heaviness acting like a pendulum, and adding
considerably to the roll of the ship, should the weather
prove rough.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly after seven <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we got fairly clear of the
dock. Strange to think, as the last hawser was being
cast off, that, till our return, we should hear no postman’s
ring, receive no letters with either good tidings
or annoyances—for we carry the mail,—and see no later
newspapers than those we take with us! Friends may
be well or ill. The stirring events of the Continent,
too, leave us to speculate on changes that may suddenly
occur in the aspect of European affairs, with the chances
of peace, or declarations of war.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, allowing such thoughts to disturb me as little
as possible, and trusting that, under a kind Providence,
all would be well with those dear to me, hopefully, and
not without a deep feeling of inward satisfaction that a
long cherished dream of boyhood was now about to be
realised, I turned my face to the North.</p>

<p class='c011'>A dense mist having settled on the Frith of Forth,
the captain deemed it prudent to anchor in the roads.
During the night it cleared off, and at five o’clock on
Thursday morning, 21st July, our star was in the
ascendant, and the “Arcturus” got fairly under way.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morning, bright and clear, was truly splendid;
the day sunny and warm; many sails in sight, and
numerous sea-birds kept following the ship.</p>

<p class='c011'>Breakfast, dinner, and tea follow each other in regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>succession, making, with their pleasant reunions and
friendly intercourse, a threefold division of the day. On
shipboard the steward’s bell becomes an important institution,
a sort of repeating gastronomical chronometer,
and is not an unpleasant sound when the fresh sea-air
has sharpened one’s appetite into expectancy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The commissariat supplies were liberal, and the
department well attended to by a worthy Dane, who
spoke no English, and who was only observed to smile
once during the voyage. Captain Andriessen’s fluent
English, and the obliging Danish stewardess’ German,
enabled us all to get along in a sort of way; although
the conversation at times assumed a polyglot aspect,
the ludicrous <i>olla-podrida</i> nature of which afforded us
many a good hearty laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief peculiarities in our bill of fare were <i>lax</i> or
red-smoked salmon; the sweet soups of Denmark, with
raisins floating in them; black stale rye-bread; and a
substantial dish, generally produced thrice a day, which,
in forgetfulness of the technical nomenclature, we shall
venture to call beef-steak fried with onions or garlic—that
bulb which Don Quixote denounced as pertaining
to scullions and low fellows, entreating Sancho to
eschew it above all things when he came to his Island.
At sea, however, we found it not unpalatable. There
must ever be some drawbacks on shipboard. One of
these was the water produced at table, of which
Captain Forbes funnily remarked, that it “tasted badly
of bung cloth—and dirty cloth, too!” But, such as it
was, the Professor and I preferred it to wine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus much of culinary matters, for, with the exception
of a few surprises, which, according to all our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>previous ideas, confused the chronology of the dishes—making
a literal mess of it—and sundry minor variations
in the cycle of desserts proper, the service of one day
resembled that of another.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was only wind enough to fill the mainsail, and
in it, on the lea side of the boom, as if in a hammock,
sheltered from the broiling sun, I lay resting for hours.
Off Peterhead, we saw innumerable fishing boats—counted
205 in one fleet. Off Inverness, far out at sea,
we counted as many, ere we gave in and stopped.
Their sails were mostly down, and we, passing quite
near, could observe the process of the fishermen shooting
their nets; the sea to the north-east all thickly dotted
with boats, which appeared like black specks. A
steamer was sailing among them, probably to receive
and convey the fish ashore.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perilous is the calling of the fisherman! Calm to-day,
squalls may overtake him on the morrow—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But men must work, and women must weep,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Though storms be sudden, and waters deep,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And the harbour bar be moaning.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>As the sun went down, from the forecastle we
watched a dense bank of cloud resting on the sea;
its dark purple ranges here and there shewing openings,
with hopeful silver linings intensely bright—glimpses,
as it were, into the land of Beulah. Then the lights
and shadows grandly massed themselves, gradually
assuming a sombre hue; while starry thoughts of dear
ones at home rose, welling up within us, as the daylight
ebbed slowly away over the horizon’s rim.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><i>Friday morning, July 22.</i>—Rose at seven; weather
dull; neither land, sky, nor sail, visible; our
position not very accurately known. At four in the
morning the engine had been stopped, the look-out
having seen breakers a-head—no observation to be had.
Our course to the North Sea lay between the Orkney
and Shetland Islands. After breakfast it cleared, and
on the starboard bow, we saw Fair Isle, so that our
course was right, although we had not known in what
part of it we were.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was cause for thankfulness that the Orkneys
had been passed in safety. Where the navigation is
intricate and requires care at best, our chances of
danger during the uncertainty of the night had doubtless
been great. The south of the Shetland Isles also
appeared to rise from the sea, dim and blue, resting on
the horizon, like clouds ethereal and dreamlike.</p>

<p class='c011'>At 11 o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, sailing past Fair Isle, made
several sketches of its varied aspects, as seen from
different points. Green and fair, this lonely island lies
about thirty miles south-west of the Shetland group,
and in the very track of vessels going north.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has no light-house, and is dreaded by sailors; for
many are the shipwrecks which it occasions. Before
now, we had heard captains, in their anxiety, wish it
were at the bottom of the sea. Could not a light be
placed upon it by the Admiralty, and a fearful loss of
life thus be averted?</p>

<p class='c011'>The island contains about a hundred inhabitants, who
live chiefly by fishing and knitting. They are both skilful
and industrious. During the winter months, the men, as
well as the women, knit caps, gloves, and waistcoats;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and for dyeing the wool, procure a variety of colours
from native herbs and lichens.</p>

<p class='c011'>True happiness, springing as it ever does from
above and from within, may have its peaceful abode
here among those lonely islanders quite apart from the
noise and bustle of what is called the great world,
although the stranger sailing past is apt to think such
places “remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Ere long we could distinguish the bold headland of
Sumburgh, which is the southern extremity of Shetland;
and a little to the north-west of it, by the aid of an opera-glass,
Fitful Head,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> rendered famous by Sir Walter Scott
as the dwelling place of Norna, in “The Pirate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Last summer I visited this the most northern group
of British islands, famed alike for skilful seamen, fearless
fishermen, and fairy-fingered knitters; for its hardy
ponies, and for that soft, warm, fleecy wool which is
peculiar to its sheep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gazing on the blue outline of the islands, I now
involuntarily recalled their many voes, wild caves, and
splintered skerries, alive with sea gulls and kittiwakes.
The magnificent land-locked sound of Bressay too, where
her Majesty’s fleet might ride in safety, and where
Lerwick—the capital of the islands, and the most
northerly town in the British dominions—with its quaint,
foreign, gabled aspect, rises, crowning the heights, from
the very water’s edge, so that sillacks might be fished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>from the windows of those houses next the sea. Boating
excursions and pony scamperings are also recalled; the
Noss Head, with its mural precipice rising sheer from
the sea to a height of 700 feet, vividly reminding one of
Edgar’s description of Dover Cliff, in “Lear,” or of that
which Horatio pictured to Hamlet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“The dreadful summit of the cliff,</div>
      <div class='line'>That beetles o’er his base into the sea....</div>
      <div class='line'>The very place puts toys of desperation,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without more motive, into every brain</div>
      <div class='line'>That looks so many fathoms to the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hears it roar beneath.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Nor is the much talked of <i>cradle</i> forgotten, slung on
ropes, for crossing the chasm between a lower cliff and
the Holm of Noss;—a detached rocky islet, the top of
which only affords pasture, during the summer months,
for some half dozen sheep.</p>

<p class='c011'>The curious and singularly-perfect ancient Pictish
or Scandinavian Burgh, in the Island of Moosa, rises
again before me; Scalloway Bay, with its old Castle in
ruins, its fishermen’s cots, and fish-drying sheds. A
high, long, out-jutting rocky promontory too, on which
I had stood watching the “yeasty waves” far below, as
they rolled thundering into an irregular cave, which, in
the course of ages, they had scooped out among the
basaltic crags, and, leaping up, scattered drenching
showers of diamond spray. Every succeeding dash of
the billows produced a loud report like the discharge
of artillery, the reverberations echoing along the shore.
In the black creek below, the brine seething like a
caldron was literally churned into white foam-flakes,
which, rising into the air on sudden gusts of wind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>sailed away inland, high overhead, like a flock of sea-birds.
These flakes were of all sizes, large masses of
froth at times floating down, and alighting at our very
feet, from so great a height that they had merely shewed
as black specks against the bright sunlight. In lulls
one could actually lift them bodily from the ground,
upwards of two cubic feet in size; but when the wind
rose, such masses of whipped sea-cream were again seized
upon, swept aloft, divided into smaller portions, and
carried away across the island. These and other pleasing
memories presented themselves as we now gazed on the
distant, dim-blue Shetland Isles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Saw a large vessel disabled and being towed southwards
from Shetland, where she appears to have come
to grief. Topmasts gone, sides battered and patched
with boards. She is high out of the water, so that the
cargo must have been discharged. All our opera-glasses
and telescopes are in requisition.</p>

<div id='fig_002'  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/fig_002.png'><img src='images/fig_002.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>FOOLA.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Sat on the boom for hours, the vessel rolling heavily
over the great smooth Atlantic billows. In the afternoon
passed the island of Foola, which has been called the St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Kilda of Shetland. It lies about sixteen miles west of
Mainland, and is high and precipitous. The cliffs are
tenanted by innumerable sea-fowls, which are caught in
thousands by the cragsmen, and afford a considerable
source of revenue to the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Blue and cloudlike the detached and isolated heights
of Mainland, Yell, and Unst—the promontory of
Hermanness, on the latter, being the most northerly
point of the British islands—are fast sinking beneath
the horizon. Ere long Foola, left astern, follows the
others. No land in sight, not a sail on the horizon; all
round is now one smooth heaving circular plain of blue
water—the ever changing level producing a most singular
optical effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the evening walked the deck with Mr. Haycock,
discoursing of Norwegian scenery, and of yacht excursions
thither. The evening clear and pleasant, although the
ground-swell continued to increase. Turned in, at half-past
ten o’clock. The vessel rolled much during the
night. Professor Chadbourne, Mr. Murray, and Mr.
Cleghorn’s berths were in the same state-room as mine.
The quarter-deck being elevated, one of our windows
opened towards the deck, and <i>could</i> at all times afford
good and safe ventilation; but the stewards always
<i>would</i> shut it, watching their opportunity of doing so
when we were asleep. We always opened it again, when
on waking we found the deed had been done; and all of
us made a point of shouting out ferociously when we
caught them stealthily at it. This shutting and opening
occurred several times every night, and seemed destined
to go on, spite of all our remonstrances; a nuisance only
relieved by a slight dash of the ludicrous. Danes don’t
seem to like fresh air.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><i>Saturday morning, July 23.</i>—No land in sight,
open sea from Norway to America; heavy swell on the
Atlantic, and wind changing from N.E. to N.W.;
numerous whales blowing, quite close to the vessel;
gulls and kittiwakes flying about.</p>

<p class='c011'>At mid-day came in sight of the Faröe Islands rising
above the horizon; fixed the first glimpse of them, and
continued sketching their outline from time to time, as
on nearing them it developed itself—watching with
great interest the seeming clouds slowly becoming crags.
Little Dimon, a lofty rock-island, somewhat resembling
Ailsa, and purple in the distance, was, from the first, the
most prominent and singular object on the horizon line.</p>

<p class='c011'>The waves rolling so heavily that not only the hull,
but the mast of a sloop, not very far off, is quite hid by
each long swell. The Professor, Dr. Livingston, and Mr.
Murray all agree in saying that they never had such
heavy seas in crossing the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Faröe group consists of twenty-two islands,
seventeen of which are inhabited. A bird’s-eye view of
them would exhibit a series of bare, steep, oblong hills,
in parallel ranges; with either valleys or narrow arms of
the sea between them, and all lying north-west and
south-east. The name Faröe is said to be derived from
<i>faar</i> or <i>foer</i>, the old word for a sheep; that animal
having probably been introduced by the Norse sea-rovers
long before these islands were permanently colonised
<a id='tn12'></a>in the time of Harold. However, <i>fier</i>—the Danish
word for feathers—is more likely to be the correct
etymology; for these islands are the native habitat of
innumerable sea-birds.</p>

<p class='c011'>They lie 185 miles north-west of the Shetland Isles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>400 west of Norway, and 320 south-east of Iceland;
population upwards of 3000, and subject to Denmark.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are now approaching Suderoe, the most southerly
of the islands. On our left lie several curious detached
rocks, near one of which, called the Monk, is a whirlpool,
dangerous in some states of the tide; although its perils,
like those of Corrivreckan between Jura and Scarba in
the Hebrides, have been greatly exaggerated. On one
occasion I sailed over the latter unharmed by Sirens,
Mermaids, or Kelpies; only observing an irregular fresh
on the water, where the tide-ways met, and hearing
nothing save a dripping, plashing noise in the cross-cut
ripple, as if many fish were leaping around the boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>In storms, however, such places had better receive a
wide berth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The approach to the Faröe group is very fine, presenting
to our view a magnificent panorama of fantastically-shaped
islands—peaked sharp angular bare precipitous
rocks, rising sheer from the sea; the larger-sized islands
being regularly terraced in two or more successive grades
of columnar trap-rock. Some of these singular hill-islets
are sharp along the top, like the ridge of a house, and
slope down on either side to the sea, at an angle of fifty
degrees. Others of them are isolated stacks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hard trap-rock, nearly everywhere alternating
with soft tufa, or claystone, sufficiently accounts for the
regular, stair-like terraces which form a striking and
characteristic feature of these picturesque islands. The
whole have evidently, in remote epochs, been subjected
to violent physical abrasion, probably glacial, during the
period of the ice-drift; and, subsequently, to the
disintegrating crumbling influences of moisture, and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the atmosphere itself. Frost converts each particle of
moisture into a crystal expanding wedge of ice, which
does its work silently but surely and to an extent which
few people would imagine.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now pass that singular rock-island, Little Dimon,
which supports a few wild sheep; and Store Dimon, on
which only one family resides. The cliffs here, as also
on others of the islands, are so steep that boats are
lowered with ropes into the sea; and people landing are
either pulled up by ropes, or are obliged to clamber up
by fixing their toes and fingers in holes cut on the face
of the rock. Sea-fowls and eggs are every year collected
in thousands from these islets by the bold cragsmen.
These men climb from below; or, like the samphire-gatherer—“dreadful
trade”—are let down to the nests
by means of a rope, and there they pursue their perilous
calling while hanging in “midway air” over the sea.
They also sometimes approach the cliffs at night, in
boats, carrying lighted torches, which lure and dazzle the
birds that come flying around them, so that they are
easily knocked down with sticks, and the boat is thus
speedily filled. As many as five thousand birds have
been taken in one year from Store Dimon alone, and in
former times they were much more numerous.</p>

<p class='c011'>We watch clouds like white fleecy wool rolling past,
and apparently being raked by the violet-coloured peaks;
whilst others lower down are pierced and rest peacefully
among them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having passed Sandoe, through the Skaapen Fiord,
we see Hestoe, Kolter, Vaagoe, and other distant blue
island heights in the direction of Myggenaes, the most
western island of the group. We now sail between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Stromoe on the west, and Naalsöe on the east. Stromoe
is the central and largest island of the group, being
twenty-seven miles long and seven broad. It contains
Thorshavn, the capital of Faröe. Naalsöe, the needle
island, is so called from a curious cave at the south end
which penetrates the island from side to side like the
eye of a needle—larger, by a long way, than Cleopatra’s.
Daylight shews through it, and, in calm weather, boats
can sail from the one side to the other. We observe a
succession of sea-caves in the rocks as we sail along, the
action of the waves having evidently scooped out the
softer strata, and left the columnar trap-rock hanging
like a pent-house over each entrance. These caves are
tenanted by innumerable sea-birds. On the brink of
the water stand restless glossy cormorants; along the
horizontal rock-ledges above them, sit skua-gulls, kittiwakes,
auks, guillemots, and puffins, in rows; and
generally ranged in the order we have indicated, beginning
with the cormorant on the lower stones or rocks
next the sea, and ending with the puffin, which takes
the highest station in this bird congress.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>If disturbed, they raise a harsh, confused, deafening
noise; screaming and fluttering about in myriads. Their
numbers are so frequently thinned, and in such a variety
of ways, that old birds may, on these occasions, be
excused for exhibiting signs of alarm.</p>

<div id='fig_003'  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/fig_003.png'><img src='images/fig_003.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>NAALSÖE.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Faröese eat every kind of sea-fowl, with the
exception of gulls, skuas, and cormorants; but are partial
to auks, guillemots, and puffins. They use them either
fresh, salted or dried. The rancid fishy taste of sea-birds
resides, for the most part, in the skin only—that removed,
the rest is generally palatable. In the month of May
the inhabitants of many of the islands subsist chiefly on
eggs. Feathers form an important article of export.</p>

<p class='c011'>We watched several gulls confidingly following the
steamer; one in particular, now flying over the deck as
far as the funnel, now falling astern to pick up bits of
biscuit that were thrown overboard to it. Long I stood
admiring its beautiful soft downy plumage, its easy
graceful motions, the great distance to which a few
strokes of its powerful pinions urged it forward, or,
spread bow-like and motionless, allowed it simply to
float and at times remain poised in the air right over
the deck, now peering down with its keen yet mild eyes,
and leaving us to surmise what embryo ideas of wonder
might now be passing through its little bird-brain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Danish officer raised, levelled his piece, and fired;
the poor thing screamed like a child, threw up its wings,
turned round, and fell upon the sea like a stone; its
companions came flying confusedly in crowds to see
what was wrong with it, and received another shower of
lead for their pains.</p>

<p class='c011'>Holding no peace-society, vegetarian, homeopathic &#38;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>views, I do not object to the <i>bona fide</i> clearing of a
country from dangerous animals; or to shooting, when
rendered necessary for supplying our wants; but—from
the higher, healthier platform of Christian manliness,
reason and common sense—would most emphatically
protest against thoughtless or wanton cruelty. Such
barbarism could not be indulged in, much less be
regarded as sport, but from sheer thoughtlessness in
the best; while, under almost any circumstances, the
destruction of animal life will, by the true gentleman,
be regarded as a painful necessity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who love sport for its own sake may be divided
into three classes—the majority of sportsmen it is to be
hoped belonging to the first of these divisions;—viz.,
the thoughtless, who have never considered the subject
at all, or looked at any of its bearings; those whose
blunted feelings are, in one direction, estranged from
the beauty and joy of existence; and the third and last
class, where civilization makes so near an approach to
the depravity of savage natures, that a tiger-like eagerness
to destroy life takes possession of a man and
becomes a passion. He then only reckons the number
of braces bagged, and considers not desolate nests,
broken-winged pining birds, and the many dire tragedies
wrought on the moor by his murderous gun.</p>

<p class='c011'>A study of the habits of birds, taking cognizance of all
the interesting <a id='tn17'></a>ongoings of their daily lives, of their
wonderful instincts and labours of love, would, we should
think, make a man of rightly-constituted mind feel the
necessity of destroying them to be painful; and he certainly
would not choose to engage in it as sport. The
fable of the boys and the frogs is in point, and the term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“sport,” thus applied, is surely a cruel, and certainly a
one-sided word. In low natures, sympathy becomes
totally eclipsed and obscured by selfishness; and all
selfishness is sin.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although shocked at witnessing the needless destruction
of the poor gull, for the sake of the officer,
who was of a gentle kindly nature, doubtless belonging
to the “first division,” we tried hard to palliate the
deed; but that pitiful cry of agony haunts us yet!</p>

<p class='c021'>Whales rising to the surface and spouting around the
vessel; also shoals of porpoises tumbling and gambolling
about; sometimes swimming in line so as closely to
resemble the coils of a snake moving along; such an
appearance has probably originated the mythic sea-serpent.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are still many caves in the rocks close on the
sea; innumerable birds flying out of them and settling
on the surface of the heaving water close under the cliffs.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now approach a little bay, surrounded by an
amphitheatre of bare hills; the hollow, for a wonder,
slopes down to the shore; we observe patches of green
among the rocks, and a flag flying. Several fishing
sloops lie at anchor, but there is no appearance of a town.
Here we are told is Thorshavn, the capital of Faröe—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>haven of Thor. As we approach, we discover that
it is a town, the chief part of it built upon a rocky
promontory which divides the bay; we can also distinguish
the church and fort. The green tint we had
observed is grassy turf—but it happens to be growing
on the roofs of the wooden houses; and the houses are
scattered irregularly among the brown rocks. On the
promontory, house rises above house from the water’s
edge; and the black, wooden church tower rising behind
appears to crown them all. On an eminence, to the
right of the town, is the battery or fort, with a flagstaff
in front. All glasses in requisition, we curiously
examine the place and discover several wooden jetties—landing
places for fishing boats. Beneath the fort and
all round, split fish are spread on the rocks to dry;
many square fish-heaps also are being pressed under
boards, with heavy stones placed above them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scenery around is not unlike that of Loch Long
in Scotland, while the general aspect of Thorshavn
itself resembles the pictures of old towns given in the
corners of maps of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we enter the bay with colours flying, the Danish
flag is run up at the fort, displayed by the sloops, and
flutters from the flagstaff at Mr. Müller’s house. This
gentleman is one of the local authorities and also agent
for the steamer. A cold wind blows down the ravine,
boats are coming off, the steam-whistle rejoices on hearing
itself echoed among the hills, and the anchor is let
go. Now, that we are near it, the town appears really
picturesque and carries one several hundred years
back, with its veritable old-world, higgledy-piggledy
quaintness.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Saturday night</i>, 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>—Went on shore in the
captain’s boat, called at Mr. Müller’s office—a comfortable
new erection—and then separated into parties to
explore the place. Crowds of men, women, and children,
standing at every door, stare at us with undisguised
child-like wonder; the men—middle-sized stalwart
fellows with light hair and weathered faces—taking off
their caps to us as we pass along returning their salutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An ancient fishy smell,” together with a strong
flavour of turf-smoke, decidedly predominate over sundry
other nondescript odours in this strange out-landish
town. The results of our exploration are embodied in
the following jottings, which, at all events, participate
so far in the spirit of the place as to resemble its ground-plan.</p>

<p class='c011'>Houses, stone for a few feet next the ground, then
wood, tarred or painted black, and generally two stories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>in height; small windows, the sashes of which are painted
white; green turf on the roofs. The interiors of the
poorer sort of houses are very dark; an utter absence of
<i>voluntary</i> ventilation; one fire, and that in the kitchen,
the chimney often only a hole in the roof. Yet even in
these hovels there is generally a guest-room, comfortably
boarded and furnished. In such apartments we observed
chairs, tables, chests of drawers, feather-beds, down
coverlets, a few books, engravings on the walls, specimens
of ingenious native handiwork, curiosities, &#38;c. This
juxtaposition under the same roof was new to us, and
struck every one as something quite peculiar and contrary
to all our previous experiences. The streets of
Thorshavn are only narrow dirty irregular passages,
often not more than two or three feet wide; one walks
upon bare rock or mud. These passages wind up steep
places, and run in all manner of zigzag directions, so
that the most direct line from one point to another
generally leads “straight down crooked lane and all
round the square.” Observed a man on the top of a
house cutting grass with a sickle. Here the approach
of spring is first indicated by the turf roofs of the houses
becoming green. Being invited, we entered several
fishermen’s houses; they seemed dark, smoky, and dirty;
and, in all, the air was close and stifling. In one,
observed a savoury pot of puffin broth, suspended from
the ceiling and boiling on a turf fire built open like a
smith’s forge, the smoke finding only a very partial
egress by the hole overhead; on the wall hung a number
of plucked puffins and guillemots; several hens seen
through the smoke sitting contentedly perched on a
spar evidently intended for their accommodation in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>corner of the apartment; a stone hand-mill for grinding
barley, such as Sarah may have used, lay on the floor;
reminding one of the East, from whence the Scandinavians
came in the days of Odin.</p>

<p class='c011'>In passing along the street we saw strips of whale-flesh,
black and reddish-coloured, hanging outside the
gable of almost every house to dry, just as we have seen
herrings in fishing-villages on our own coasts. When a
shoal of whales is driven ashore by the boatmen, there
are great rejoicings among the islanders, whose faces, we
were told, actually shine for weeks after this their season
of feasting. What cannot be eaten at the time is dried
for future use. Boiled or roasted it is nutritious, and
not very unpalatable. The dried flesh which I tasted
resembled tough beef, with a flavour of venison. Being
“blood-meat,” I would not have known it to be from
the sea; and have been told that, when fresh and
properly cooked, tender steaks from a young whale can
scarcely be distinguished from beef-steak.</p>

<p class='c011'>The costume of the men is curious, and somewhat like
that of the Neapolitans;—a woollen cap, like the
Phrygian, generally dark-blue or reddish; a long jacket
and knee-breeches, both of coarse home-made cloth,
blue or brown; long stockings; and thin, soft, buff-coloured
lamb-skin shoes, made of one piece of leather,
and without hard soles, so that they can find sure
footing with them on the rocks, or use their toes when
climbing crags almost as well as if they had their bare
feet. There is less peculiarity in the female costume.
The men and women generally have light hair and blue
eyes. Honest and industrious, crime is scarcely known
amongst them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Visited the Fort, which is very primitive; simply a
little space on a hill-side, enclosed with a low rough
stone wall; four small useless cannon lying on the grass,
enjoying a sinecure—literally lying in clover; a wooden
sentry-box in the corner; a <a id='tn23'></a>flagstaff in front of it, and
two little cottages behind, to accommodate several of
the garrison, who prefer living there to lodging in the
town, as their comrades do. There are only some eight
or ten soldiers altogether; and these, with the commander,
constitute the sole military establishment in
Faröe. They appear to occupy themselves with fishing,
&#38;c., very much like the other inhabitants of the place.</p>

<div id='fig_005'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>FORT.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Visited the library, which was established by a former
Amptman or Governor. It occupies two rooms, which
are shelved all round and comfortably heated with a
stove. We observed many standard Danish, German,
French and English books, several valuable folio works
of reference, and many trashy modern novels. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Faröese are inquisitive and intelligent, show a taste for
reading, but possess no native literature like the
Icelanders.</p>

<p class='c011'>Visited the church, which is built of wood. The service
performed in it is the Lutheran, as in Denmark. It
contains an altar-piece intended to represent “Joseph
of Arimathea with the dead body of Christ,” two large
candles, and a silver and ebony crucifix. The galleries,
of plain unvarnished wood, are arranged like opera
stalls, one above the other from the floor, and with
green curtains to each. At the right side of the pulpit
were three large sand-glasses, an old custom once
common in all our churches; fronting the altar was the
organ-loft. Everything about the church was neat,
clean, and primitive. Flower-beds were planted so as
to form wreaths or crosses on the graves in the churchyard;
and all appeared to be carefully tended and kept
in order by loving hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Went by invitation of Fraulein Löbner to drink tea
at her mother’s, the Danish officer with me. We were
ushered into a charming old-fashioned room with low
panelled roof; everything in it was neat, scrupulously
clean, and primitive. A valance of white Nottingham lace-curtain
ran along the top of the diamond-paned lattice
windows; while a row of flower-pots, with blooming
roses and geraniums, stood in the window-sill. There
were cabinets with rich old china-ware; several paintings
on the wall, two of which were really excellent—one, a
portrait in oil of her late father who had been Governor
of Faröe; the other a portrait of her brother, also
deceased. Her father was a Dane of German extraction;
and her mother—a kindly old lady to whom we were
now introduced—a native of Faröe.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>At tea we had preserves, made from rhubarb grown
in their own garden; a silver ewer of delicious cream
highly creditable to Faröese dairyship; and buns, tarts,
almond-cakes, &#38;c., baked by the one baker of Thorshavn,
and quite as good as could be had in London.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the officer was sketching from the window, our
kind hostess wound up a musical box, at the same time
expressing her regret that the piano-forte, which I had
observed standing in the room, was under repair. She
also showed us a folio of her own drawings, and many
engravings. Here a lady of cultivated mind, and who
has mingled in good society, is happy and content to
dwell in this remote isle; for to her it <a id='tn25'></a>possesses the magic
of that endearing word—home!</p>

<p class='c011'>She tells us that wool, fish, feathers, and skins form
the chief articles of export; that barley is the only grain
raised in Faröe, but the summer is so short that it has
not time to ripen. The ears are plucked by the hand
and dried in a kiln. The rye, of which their black bread
is made, is imported chiefly from Denmark. The hay-harvest
is of great importance to the inhabitants. There
are numerous sheep in the islands—some individuals
possessing flocks of from four to five hundred, besides a
few ponies and cows. Dried, the mutton is serviceable
for food during winter, when frequent storms interfere
with fishing operations.</p>

<p class='c011'>As in Shetland, the wool is collected from the sheep
by the hand, at the season of the year when they are
casting their fleeces; for shearing, besides being a more
painful process, would deprive them of the long hair so
necessary for their protection in an uncertain climate,
and leave them to shiver exposed to the untempered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>fury of the northern blast. The sheep thus enables the
islanders to supply their own home wants, and also
annually to export many thousand pairs of knitted stockings
and gloves, together with the overplus raw material.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss L. informs us that Thorshavn contains about
eight hundred inhabitants. Of these, most of the men
are fishers when the weather will admit of their going
off. The people are very ingenious, and make knives of
all sizes, with curiously inlaid wooden handles and
sheaths. The wood for such purposes is obtained from
logs of mahogany, which are frequently found as drift-wood
among these islands. We were shewn a home-made
fancy work-table, neatly put together in a very ingenious
and workman-like manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Each man here is a sort of Jack-of-all-trades, from the
mending of boats or nets, to the killing of sheep and
drying them in sheds for the winter store of provisions;
from the making of <a id='tn26'></a>lamb-skin shoes to the building of
houses, or the manufacture of implements.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Löbner has kindly and obligingly undertaken to
procure some specimens of these manufactures and local
curiosities against my return from Iceland.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gazing round, as we take leave of our kind entertainers,
I fix in my mind’s eye the lady-like air and
quaint point-devise costume of the elder lady, who, with
silvery hair combed back from her brow, had moved
about most assiduously performing all the sacred rites of
hospitality to her guests; the mediæval aspect of everything
in the room,—from the stove to the timepiece,
from the polished wooden floor to the panelled ceiling;
the diamond-paned lattice windows, with their old-world
outlook on the town and the flat wooden bridge, close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>by, which crosses a brawling stream rushing impetuously
over rocks from the gully behind; the absolute cleanness
and polish of everything; and the monthly roses blooming
freshly as of old;—all so vividly impress themselves
upon my mind that the whole becomes a waking dream
of other days; and it would not seem much out of keeping,
or at all surprising, were the Emperor Charles V.
himself to open the door and walk into the quaint old
apartment we are now about to leave.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nine <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>—Wandered alone by the shore, and
sketched the view, looking north, from beneath the fort;
also made a drawing of the bay from the wooden jetty;
while engaged on the latter, crowds of fishermen gathered
around me making odd remarks of wonder, the general
scope of which I could gather, as they recognised the
steamer, boats, hills, &#38;c., coming up on the paper;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>sketched one of the onlookers, an intelligent looking
fellow, and here he is.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>FARÖESE BOATMAN.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The fishing boats or skiffs, have all the high bow and
stern of the Norwegian yawl; square lug-sails very broad
and carried low are the most common. The weather
is so very uncertain, the gusts so sudden and violent,
that, preceded by a lull during which a lighted candle
may be carried in the open air, they come roaring down
the valleys or between the islands, bellowing with a
noise like thunder, and sometimes strip the turf from
the hill side, roll it up like a sheet of lead and carry it
away into the sea, while the air is darkened by clouds
of dust and stones.</p>

<p class='c011'>Felt comfortably warm when sketching in the open
air between ten and eleven <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, for, though the climate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>is moist, the mean temperature is warmer than that of
Denmark, and, on account of the gulf stream, not much
below our own. Forchhammer states that at Thorshavn
in mild years, it is 49·2°; in cold years, 42·3°; the average
temperature being 45·4°. The greatest height of the
thermometer during his observations was 72·5°, and the
lowest 18·5°.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly before eleven o’clock the soldiers of the fort
manned their boat, and rowed us off to the steamer.</p>

<p class='c011'>After narrating our various experiences on shore, had
a pleasant quiet home-talk with Professor Chadbourne,
read a few verses of the New Testament, and as the week
was drawing to a close we retired to our berths, wishing
each other a good night’s rest after all the novel excitement,
wonder, and fatigues of the day.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Sabbath, July 24.</i>—Wind high, and the lashing rain
pouring down in torrents. Went ashore at ten o’clock
to attend church; heard the pleasing sound of psalm-singing
in various of the fishermen’s dwellings as we passed
along. Called for <a id='tn29'></a>Mr. Müller, who had invited me to his
pew. The service was Lutheran, and began at eleven
o’clock. The pastor was absent, but the assistant, M.
Lützen, who is also schoolmaster and organist, officiated.
All the people, singing lowly, joined in several fine old
German chorales, led by the organist, who also played
some of Sebastian Bach’s music with much taste and
feeling—although little indebted to the instrument, which
was old and infirm, piping feebly and tremulously in its
second childhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>The area of the church was entirely occupied by women,
many of them with their bare heads, but most of them
with a quaint little covering on the back part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>head for hair and comb; only saw two bonnets in the
whole congregation. One old lady—with her hair combed
back, a black silk covering on the back part of her head,
and, from where it terminated behind her ears, a stiff
white frill sticking right out—looked as if she had just
stepped out from one of Holbein’s pictures; others
resembled Gerard Dow’s old women. The men “were
drest, in their Sunday’s best;”—long jackets and knee-breeches
of coarse blue or brown cloth, frequently ornamented
with rows of metal buttons; stockings of the
same colours; and the never-varying buff-coloured lamb-skin
shoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was pleasing to see these stalwart descendants of
the brave old Vikings “the heathen of the Northern
sea,”—these men whose daily avocations exposed them
to constant perils by sea and land, here, in the very
haven of Thor, walking reverently into a Christian church,
with their caps and Bibles in their hands, and quietly
entering their pews to worship God.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although the day was very wet, and the regular
minister absent, there was present a congregation of
about two hundred; and all seemed truly devotional
during the service.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the roof, between two old-fashioned brass chandeliers,
was suspended a brig, probably the gift of some
sailor preserved from shipwreck. The service began at
eleven o’clock, and ended at half-past twelve. When it
was over, I spoke with Skolare Lützen, who had officiated.
He is a native of Copenhagen, speaks little
English, but good German. He took me over the building,
and into the pulpit. Altogether, the quaint appearance
of the church, the organ, the singing of the people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the devout reading and simplicity of the service, and the
curious old costumes carried one back to the time of the
Reformation, and to me all was singularly interesting.
One could fancy that here, if anywhere, the European
world had stood still, and that Luther himself would not
have detected the lapse of centuries, if permitted once
more to gaze on such a scene as was here presented.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two of us accompanied <a id='tn31'></a>Mr. Müller to his house before
going on board the steamer. His wife and daughter
were hospitable and kind; and, as usual on a visit here,
tarts, cakes, and wine were produced. His home resembles
a museum, containing many stuffed birds, eggs,
geological specimens and other natural curiosities collected
in these islands. His little son’s name is Erasmus.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Andriessen had wished to sail to-day, but
could not get men to work on Sabbath discharging the
cargo; at which I was well pleased, both for the right
feeling it indicated on the part of the Faröese, and for
our own sakes. Here we lie peacefully anchored in the
bay, enjoying the Sabbath quiet, while the tempest is
now howling wildly outside the islands, and the lashing
pelting rain is pouring down on the deck overhead like
a shower-bath.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>

      <div class='line in1'>Remember to have heard.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The rain having abated, ere retiring for the night,
walked the deck for half an hour. Thorshavn, as seen
in the strong light and shade of evening from the
steamer’s deck, has truly a most quaint old-world
look—all the more so now that we know it from
exploration—so very primitive that one can scarcely
imagine anything like it. It is unique.</p>

<p><span class='small'>BASALT CAVES—SOUTH POINT OF STROMOE.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Monday morning, July 25.</i>—From an early hour,
all hands busily occupied discharging the cargo, heavily-laden
boats following each other to the shore. At half-past
one o’clock, the last boat pushes off, the steam-whistle
is blown, and we sail away round the south point
of Stromoe, shaping our course north-west through
Hestoe Fiord. The coast of the islands is abrupt,
mostly rising sheer from the sea; many basaltic
columns, and a succession of wave-worn caves, in front of
which countless sea-birds are flying, swimming and diving.
The trap hills are regularly terraced like stairs.
Clouds drifting among the hills, and from every gully
cataracts leaping down in white foam to the sea. The
general colour of the rocks is gray and brown, slightly
touched here and there with green. These islands
might be characterized as several groups or chains of
hills, lying nearly parallel to each other and separated
by narrow arms of the sea, which run in straight lines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>north-west and south-east. The summits of the larger
islands reach an elevation of from one to two thousand
feet; while the highest hill—Slattaretind, near Eide in
Oesteroe—is two thousand nine hundred feet high.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hills around still exhibit a succession of grassy
declivities, alternating with naked walls of black or
brown rock. The flat heights of these islands, we are
told, are either bare rock or marshy hollows. There are
also several small lakes, the largest of which, in Vaagoe,
is only two miles in circumference, and lies surrounded
by wild rugged mountain masses.</p>

<p class='c011'>We count a dozen foaming cataracts, all in sight at
once, and falling down over precipitous rocks around
us into the sea. The wind perceptibly sways them
hither and thither, and then dispersing the lower portion
of the water raises it in silvery clouds of vapour
on which rainbows play. They resemble the Staubach
in Switzerland; and remind us of the wild mist-veil
apparition of Kühleborn, in the charming story of
Undine.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tidal currents, in the long narrow straits which
divide the northern islands from each other, are strong
but regular; running six hours the one way and six hours
the other. Boatmen must calculate and wait for the
stream, as the oar is powerless against it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The atmospheric effects are beautiful;—a bold headland,
ten miles to the south, appears in the bright sunshine
to be of the deepest violet colour; no magic of the
pencil could approach such a tint. It is heightened too
by the white gleaming sail of a fishing smack relieved
against it.</p>

<p class='c011'>When we got clear of the islands, the ground-swell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>became much heavier; for the storm of the preceding
day had been terrific. Great heavy waves of smooth
unbroken water, worse than Spanish rollers; boat
tumbling and plunging about, with sail set to steady
her; walked the deck for an hour and found use for my
sea-legs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several gulls follow the ship; I never tire of watching
their graceful motions, as, with white downy plumage
and wings tipt with black, they fly forward round the
mast, remain poised over the deck, or fall astern keeping
in the steamer’s wake. Two of our companions have
discovered a capital sheltered nook and sit smoking,
perched up inside the large inverted boat which we
are taking north with us.</p>

<p class='c011'>An Icelander and a Dane are among the second-class
passengers; got them to read aloud to me Icelandic and
Danish, also Greek and Latin. In pronouncing the
latter two, they follow the classic mode and give the
broad vowel sounds, as taught in the German and Scottish
universities but not at Oxford or Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dim Faröes are fast falling astern—</p>

      <div class='line'>“Far-off mountains turnéd into clouds.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The vessel by the log makes eight knots—course, N.
by W. and sails set.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day lengthens as we go north, and at midnight
I can now see to read large print, although the
sky is very cloudy.</p>

<p class='c011'>No land—no sail in sight; we heave over the billows
of the lonely Northern Sea, and now all is clear before
us for Iceland!</p>

  <h2 id='ch2' class='c010'><span class='xxlarge'>THE WESTMANNA ISLANDS—REYKJAVIK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Tuesday morning, July 26.</i> Open sea and not a sail
visible, although we carefully scan “the round ocean.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tremendous rolling all night; everything turning
topsy-turvy and being knocked about—my portmanteau,
which was standing on the cabin floor, capsized. Only
by dint of careful adjustment and jambing in the form
of the letter z could we prevent ourselves from being
shot out of our berths.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day we have the heaviest rolling I ever experienced.
It is impossible even to sit on the hurricane deck without
holding on by a rope, and not easy even with such
assistance. Deck at an angle of 40 to 45°. The boat
fastened aloft aggravates matters. A very little more, or
the slightest shifting of the cargo, would throw us on our
beam ends. The boat getting loose from its fastenings
when we are on the larboard roll would break off the
funnel. The Captain has hatchets ready, at once to send
it overboard or break it up if requisite for our safety.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The bell tolling with the roll of the ship, first on the one
side, and then on the other; generally four or five times
in succession. A series of large rollers alternate with
lesser waves; the bell indicates the former. Waves
without wind roll in from the N. and N.W., both on the
starboard and port bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the afternoon saw a piece of wreck—mast and
cordage—floating past, most likely a record of woe;
involving waiting weary hearts that will not die.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not a speck on the whole horizon line; a feeling of
intense loneliness would at times momentarily creep over
us. Birds overhead flying south brought to mind
Bryant’s beautiful poem addressed to “The Waterfowl,”
which he describes as floating along darkly painted on
the crimson sky:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“There is a Power whose care</div>
      <div class='line'>Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The desert and illimitable air</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Lone wandering but not lost.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Thou’rt gone, the abyss of heaven</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And shall not soon depart.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>He, who from zone to zone</div>
      <div class='line'>Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the long way that I must tread alone</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Will lead my steps aright.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The heavy rolling still continues. Hope the cargo
will keep right, or we shall come to grief. Thought of
the virtues of my friends. However, maugre a dash of
danger, a group of us on the hurricane deck really
enjoyed the scene as if we had been veritable Mother
Carey’s chickens. One sang Barry Cornwall’s song
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“The Sea;” another by way of contrast gave us “Annie
Laurie” and “Scots wha hae wi’ Wallace bled;” and
towards evening we all joined in singing “York;” that
grand old psalm tune harmonizing well with the place
and time—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The setting sun, and music at the close!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The gulf-stream and the rollers meeting make a wild
jumble. Barometer very low—28<sup><span class='under'>10</span></sup>; low enough for a
hurricane in the tropics. Stormy rocking in our sea-cradle
all day and all night.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Wednesday, July 27.</i>—Vessel still rolling as much as
ever. Saw a skua—a black active rapacious bird, a sort of
winged pirate—chasing a gull which tried hard to evade it
by flying, wavering backwards and forwards, <a id='tn37'></a>zig-zagging,
doubling, now rising and now falling, till at last, wearied
out and finding escape impossible, it disgorged and dropt
a fish which the skua pounced upon, picking it up before
it could reach the surface of the sea. The fish alone had
been the object of the skua’s pursuit. The skua is at
best but a poor fisher and takes this method of supplying
its wants at second hand. Subsequently we often
observed skuas following this their nefarious calling;
unrelentingly chasing and attacking the gulls until they
gave up their newly caught fish, when they were at once
left unmolested and allowed to go in peace; but whether
the sense of wrong or joy at escape predominated, or
with what sort of feelings and in what light the poor
gulls viewed the transaction, a man would require to be
a bird in order to form an adequate idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>We cannot now be far from Iceland, but clouds above
and low thick mists around preclude the possibility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>taking observations or seeing far before us. In clear
weather we are told that the high mountains are visible
from a distance of 100 or 150 miles at sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>At half-past Three o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, peering hard through
the mist, we discover, less than a mile ahead, a white
fringe of surf breaking on a low sandy shore for which
we are running right stem on. It is the south of Iceland;
dim heights loom through the haze; the vessel’s head is
turned more to the west and we make for sailing, in a
westerly direction with a little north in it, along the
shore up the western side of the island which in shape
somewhat resembles a heart.</p>

<div id='fig_010'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>NEEDLE <a id='tn38'></a>ROCKS—OFF PORTLAND HUK.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The mist partially clears off and on our right we sight
Portland Huk, the most southern point of Iceland. Here
rocks of a reddish brown colour run out into the sea
rising in singular isolated forms like castellated buildings;
one mass from a particular point of view exactly resembles
the ruins of Iona, even to the square tower; other peaks are
like spires. Strange fantastic needle-like rocks or drongs
shoot up into the air—the Witches’ fingers (Trollkonefinger)
of the Northmen. The headland exhibits a great
arched opening through which, we were told, at certain
states of the tide, the steamer could sail if her masts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>were lowered. It is called Dyrhólaey—the hill door—and
from it the farm or village close by is named
Dyrhólar. Behind these curious rocks appeared a range
of greenish hills mottled with snow-patches, their white
summits hid in the rolling clouds.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are numerous waterfalls; glaciers—the ice of a
pale whity-green colour—fill the ravines and creep down
the valleys from the Jökuls to the very edge of the water.
Their progressive motion here is the same as in
Switzerland, and large blocks of lava are brought down
imbedded in their moraine. I perceived what I thought
to be curved lines on the surface like the markings on
mother-of-pearl, indicating that the downward motion of
a glacier is greater in the centre than where impeded by
friction at the sides.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the shoulders of the range of heights along the
coast, snow, brown-coloured patches and green-spots
were all intermingled; while the upper mountain regions
of perpetual snow were meanwhile for the most part hid
in clouds which turban-like swathed their brows in
fleecy “folds voluminous and vast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The steamer is running, at nine knots, straight for the
Westmanna Islands, where a mail is to be landed.
They lie off the coast nearly half way between Portland
Huk, the south point, and Cape Reykjanes the south-west
point of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c011'>How gracefully the sea-birds skim the brine, taking
the long wave-valleys, disappearing and reappearing
amongst the great heaving billows. We note many
waterfalls leaping from the mountain sides to the shore,
and at times right into the sea itself, from heights
apparently varying from two to four hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>We now approach the Westmanna Islands, so called
from ten Irish slaves—westmen—who in the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 875
took refuge here after killing Thorleif their master. They
are a group of strange fantastically shaped islets of
brown lava-rock; only three or four however have any
appearance of grass upon them, and but one island,
Heimaey—the home isle, is inhabited. The precipitous
rock-cliffs are honeycombed with holes and caves which
are haunted by millions of birds. These thickly dot the
crevices with masses of living white; hover like clouds
in the air, and swarm the waters around like a fringe—resting,
fluttering, or diving, by turns.</p>

<p class='c011'>Westmannshavn, the harbour of the islands, is a bay
on the north-west of Heimaey where a green vale slopes
down to the sea. It is sheltered by the islands of
Heimaklettur on the North, and Bjarnarey on the East.
We observed a flag flying, and a few huts scattered
irregularly and sparsely on the slope. This place is
called Kaupstadr—or head town—but there is no other
town in the group. The roofs of the huts were covered
with green sod and scarcely to be distinguished from the
grass of the slope on which they stood save by the light
blue smoke which rose curling above them from turf
fires.</p>

<p class='c011'>A row-boat came off for the mail, which, we were told,
had never before been landed here from a steamer; the
usual mode is to get it from Reykjavik in a sailing
vessel. For those accustomed to at least half a dozen
deliveries of letters every day, it was strange to think
that here there were fewer posts in a whole year. These
Islands have, on account of their excellent fisheries, from
very remote periods been much frequented by foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>vessels. Before the discovery of Newfoundland, British
merchants resorted hither, and also to ports on the west
coast of Iceland, to exchange commodities and procure
dried stock-fish. Icelandic ships also visited English
ports. This intercommunication can be distinctly traced
back to the time of Henry III.; but by the beginning
of the fifteenth century it had become regular and had
risen to importance. It was matter of treaty between
Norway and England; but, with or without special
licenses, or in spite of prohibitions—sometimes with the
connivance and permission of the local authorities, and
at other times notwithstanding the active opposition of
one or both governments—the trade being mutually profitable
to those engaged in it continued to be prosecuted.
English tapestry and linen are mentioned in old Icelandic
writings, and subsequently we learn that English
strong ale was held in high estimation by the Northmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Edward III. granted certain privileges and exemptions
to the fishermen of Blacknie and Lyne in Norfolk on
account of their Icelandic commerce. In favourable
weather the distance could be run in about a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Icelandic records we learn that in the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1412, “30 ships engaged in fishing were seen off the
coast at one time.” “In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1415 there were no fewer
than 6 English merchant ships in the harbour of Hafna
Fiord alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding the proclamations and prohibitions
both of Eric and Henry V. the traffic still continued to
increase; and we incidentally learn that in the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1419 “Twenty-five English ships were wrecked on this
coast in a dreadful snow-storm.” Goods supplied to the
natives then, as in later times, were both cheaper and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>better than could be obtained from the Danish monopolists.
It will be remembered by the reader that when
Columbus visited Iceland he sailed in a bark from the
port of Bristol.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gazing on this singular group of rocky Islands, on the
coast of Iceland, so lone and quiet, and reverting to the
early part of the thirteenth century, it was strange to
realize that into this very bay had then sailed and cast
anchor the ships of our enterprising countrymen—quaint
old-fashioned ships, such as we may still see represented
in illuminated MSS. of the period; and that their latest
news to such English merchants or fishermen as had
wintered or perhaps been stationed for some time at
Westmannshavn—supposing modern facilities for the
transmission of news—would not have been the peace of
Villafranca but the confirmation of Magna Charta;—instead
of the formation of volunteer corps, nobles
hastening to join the fifth Crusade;—not the treading
out of a Sepoy revolt, but Mongolian hordes overrunning
the Steppes of Russia;—and instead of some important
law-decision, celebrated trial, or case in Chancery,
they might hear of an acquaintance who had perished in
single combat, or who had indignantly and satisfactorily
proved his or her innocence by submitting to trial by
ordeal. These were the old times of Friar Bacon—the
days of alchemy and witchcraft. Haco had not yet been
crowned King of Norway; Snorre Sturleson was yet a
young man meditating the “Heimskringla.” The chisel
of Nicolo Pisano and the pencil of Cimabue were at
work in Italy. Neither Dante nor Beatrice as yet
existed; nor had the factions of Guelph and Ghibeline
sprung into being. Chaucer was not born till the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>following century. <a id='tn43'></a>Aladdin reigned; Alphonzo the Wise,
King of Leon and Castile, had not promulgated his code
of laws. Not a single Lombard moneylender had arrived
to settle in London; and the present structure of
Westminster Abbey had not then been reared.</p>

<p class='c011'>On leaving Westmannshavn, sailing north between the
islands of Heimaklettur and Bjarnarey, we saw two men
rowing a boat deeply laden to the gunwale with sea-fowls,
probably the result of their day’s work. The cliffs everywhere
alive with birds, and the smooth sea beneath
them, in the glorious light of the evening sun, dotted
black as if peppered with puffins and eider-ducks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nine <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Sketched various aspects of the islands

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>When the Westmanna Islands are reckoned at
fourteen, that number does not include innumerable little
rocky stacks and islets of all fantastic shapes alone or in
groups; some like Druidical stones or old ruins, others
of them far out and exactly like ships in full sail,
producing a strange effect on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The island nearest the coast of Iceland on the east of
Heimaey is called Erlendsey; that furthest north-west
is Drángr; and the furthest west Einarsdrángr. On
the south-west is an islet called Alsey; we have also an
Ailsa in the frith of Clyde: both names probably signifying
fire-isle. The islet furthest south is called Geirfuglasker.
These names are necessarily altogether omitted
on common small maps.</p>

<p class='c011'>We witness a glorious sunset on the sea,—the horizon
streaked with burning gold:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now ’gan the golden Phœbus for to steepe</div>

      <div class='line'>Whiles from his journall labours he did rest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Although the surface of the sea is quite smooth, a
heavy ground swell keeps rolling along. A bank of
violet cloud lies to the left of the sun, while dense
masses of leaden and purple-coloured clouds are piled
above it. An opening glows like a furnace seven times
heated, darting rays from its central fire athwart the
sky, and opening up a burning cone-shaped pathway of
light on the smooth heaving billows, the apex of which
reaches our prow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such the scene, as we sail north-west between the
northernmost out-lying skerries of the Westmanna group
and the south-west coast of Iceland and silently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>watch the gorgeous hues of sunset. Strangely at such
times “hope and memory sweep the chords by turns,”
till the past, fused down into the present, becomes a
magic mirror for the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>The air is mild and warm; time by Greenwich
twenty-minutes to eleven. The sun is not yet quite
down, and—by the ship’s compass, without making any
allowance for deviation—is setting due north. At a
quarter-past 12 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> when we leave the deck, it is still
quite light.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Thursday Morning, July 28.</i> Rose early—we are
sailing along the Krisuvik coast in the direction of Cape
Reykjanes—smoky cape—which runs out from the
south-west of Iceland. The low lying coast is of black
lava; behind it rise serrated hill-ranges, and isolated
conical mountains; some of a deep violet colour, others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>covered with snow and ice, the dazzling whiteness of
which is heightened by contrast with the low dark fire-scathed
foreground. White fleecy clouds are rolling
among the peaks, now dense and clearly defined against
the bright blue sunny sky—now hazy, ethereal, and
evanescent. We observe steam rising from a hot sulphur
spring on the coast. These are numerous in this
neighbourhood, which contains the principal sulphur
mines of the island. Here, where we sail, volcanic
islands have at different times arisen and disappeared;
flames too have sometimes been seen to issue from
submarine craters; this latter phenomenon the natives
describe as “the sea” being “on fire.”</p>

<div id='fig_015'  class='figcenter id001'>
<a href='images/fig_015.png'><img src='images/fig_015.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>ELDEY.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>On our left we pass Eldey—or the Fire Isle—a curious
isolated basaltic rock resembling the Bass, but much
smaller. It rose from the deep in historic times. The
top slopes somewhat, and is white; this latter appearance
has originated its Danish name “Maelsek,” which is
pronounced precisely in the same way as “meal-sack”
would be in the Scottish dialect;—in fact the words are
the same. Many solan geese flying about; whales gamboling
and spouting close to the vessel.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Nine <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, Greenwich time. Got first glimpse of
Snæfells Jökul—the fifth highest mountain in Iceland—height
4577 feet—lying nearly in a north-west direction,
far away across the blue waters of the Faxa Fiord. A
pyramid covered with perpetual snow and ice, gleaming
in the sun, its outline is now traced against a sky of
deeper blue than any of us ever beheld in Switzerland
or Italy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Faxa Fiord, situated on the south-west, is the
largest in the island, and might be described as a
magnificent bay, forming a semicircle which extends
fifty-six miles from horn to horn; while its shores are
deeply and irregularly indented by arms of the sea, or
Fiords proper, which have names of their own, such as
Hafnafiord, Hvalfiord, or Borgarfiord. Snæfell, on the
north side of it, rises from the extremity of the long
narrow strip of steep mountain promontory that runs
out into the sea, separating the Faxa from the Breida
Fiord—another large bay;—while on the south the
<a id='tn47'></a>Guldbringu Syssel, terminating with Cape Reykjanes, is
a bare low-lying black contorted lava field.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Faxa Fiord, then, sweeping in a semicircle from
Snæfell to Reykjanes, contains several minor Fiords,
and is crowded with lofty mountain-peaks, sharp, steep,
and bare. The intense clearness of the northern
atmosphere through which these appear, together with
the fine contrast of their colours—reds, purples, golden
hues, and pale lilacs; rosy-tinted snow or silvery-glittering
ice—all sharply relieved against the blue sky,
as if by magic confound southern ideas of distance, so
that a mountain which at first glance appears to be
only ten or fifteen miles distant, may in reality be forty
or fifty, and perhaps considerably more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The capital of Iceland lies in the south-east of this
great bay. We have been sailing due north from Cape
Reykjanes to the point of Skagi, and, rounding it, we
sail east by north right into the Faxa Fiord, cutting
off the southern segment of the bay, and are making
straight for Reykjavik.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several low-lying islands shelter the port and make
the anchorage secure; one of these is Videy on which
some of the government offices formerly stood, but it is
now noted as a favourite resort of eider ducks which are
here protected by law in order to obtain the down with
which <a id='tn48'></a>their nests are lined.</p>

<p class='c011'>Solitary fishermen are making for the shore in their
skiff-like boats. A French frigate and brig, a Danish
war schooner and several merchant sloops are seen
lying at anchor, shut in by the islands and a low lava
promontory. All are gaily decked with colours. On
rounding the point, Reykjavik the capital of Iceland lies
fairly before us. It is situated on a gentle greenish
slope rising from the black volcanic sand of that
“Plutonian shore.” There are grassy heights at either
side of the town and a fresh water lake like a large pond
behind it. The cathedral in the centre, built of brick
plastered brown stone colour, and the windmill on the
height to the left, are the two most prominent objects.
The front street consists of a single row of dark-coloured
Danish looking wooden houses facing the sea. These
we are told are mostly merchants’ stores. Several of
them have flag-staffs from which the Danish colours now
flutter. All our glasses are in requisition. Numerous
wooden jetties lead from the sea up to the road in front
of the warehouses, and, on these, females like the fish-women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of Calais, “withered, grotesque, wrinkled,” and
seeming “immeasurably old,” with others younger and
better looking, are busily engaged in carrying dried fish
between the boats and the stores. Young and old alike
wear the graceful Icelandic female head-dress—viz. a
little black cloth scull-cap, jauntily fastened with a hair
pin on the back part of the head. From the crown of
this cap hangs a silver tube ornament, out of which flows
a long thick black silk tassel falling on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two streets run inland from the front street, and at
right angles to it. That on the left contains the Governor’s
house, and the residences of several officials. It leads to
the house where the Althing or Icelandic Parliament
now assembles, and where, in another part of the same
building, Rector Jonson teaches in the one academy of
the island. The other street on the right contains
several shops, merchants’ dwelling houses, the residence
of Jón <a id='tn49a'></a>Gudmundsson, president of the Althing, advocate,
and editor of a newspaper. It leads to the hotel, and to
the residence of Dr. <a id='tn49b'></a>Hjaltalin, a distinguished antiquarian
and the chief physician of the island. In the
same direction, a little higher up, is the lonely churchyard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between these two streets, houses stand at irregular
intervals, and nearly all have little garden-plots attached
to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the outskirts, flanking the town, which in appearance
is more Danish than Icelandic, are a few
fishermen’s huts, roofed over with green sod; and these,
we afterwards found, were more like the style of buildings
commonly to be met with throughout the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we cast anchor, the morning sunshine is gloriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>bright and clear, sea and sky intensely blue, and the
atmosphere more transparent than that of Switzerland
or Italy. Beyond Reykjavik, wild bare heights rise all
round the bay; here—mountains of a ruddy brown colour,
deeply scarred and distinctly showing every crevice;
there—snow-patches gleaming on dark purple hills;
here—lofty pyramids of glittering ice; there—cones of
black volcanic rock; while white fleecy clouds in horizontal
layers streak the distant peaks, and keep rolling down
the shoulders of the nearer Essian range.</p>

<p class='c011'>The arrival of the steamer is quite an event to the
Icelanders. A boat came off from the shore, and
another from the French brig, to get the mail-bags.
We brought tidings of the peace of Villafranca, and
heard the cheering of the French sailors when the news
was announced to them. Dr. Mackinlay, who had
remained, exploring various parts of the island, since the
previous voyage of the Arcturus, and for whom we had
letters and papers, kindly volunteered to give us
information about the Geyser expedition. From his
habits of keen observation, patient research, and kind-heartedness,
he was well qualified to do so.</p>

<p class='c011'>He recommended Geir Zöga, who had accompanied
him on board, as a good trustworthy guide. We wished
to start at once, so as to make the most of our time, but
the undertaking was a more serious affair than we had
anticipated. Ultimately, before landing, we arranged
to start next morning at eight o’clock, as the very best
we could do.</p>

<p class='c011'>The distance to be got over is 72 miles, literally
without roads or shelter; and mostly over wild rough
stony wastes, in comparison with which the bed of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>mountain water-course would be a good macadamized
road. Provisions, traps, and everything we require have
to be taken along with us.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are a party of six; the guide has two assistants;
nine riders in all, each requires a relay horse, so that
eighteen ponies for the riders, and six for the baggage
are requisite for our expedition. These have to be
bargained for and collected together by Zöga from the
farms around Reykjavik; and as the ponies now run
almost wild over the wastes in pursuit of scant herbage,
and neither receive grooming, stabling, nor feeding, this
is a work of time, and will occupy, Dr. Mackinlay tells
us, not only the whole afternoon but the greater part of
the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one had brought provisions north but myself, so
arrangements are made with the steward of the steamer
for supplying them, and mine thrown in with the rest
pro bono publico. Having fixed that Zöga should call
in the evening at the hotel and report progress, at
half-past 11 o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> we got into the Captain’s boat
to land, where, long ago, Ingolf the first colonist had
drawn his ship on shore. As the remainder of the day
is at our disposal, curiosity is on edge to explore
Reykjavik, the general plan and appearance of which
has already been described—partly by anticipation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun-glare is oppressively hot. As we approach
the jetty we observe groups of men and women standing
on the beach to see the passengers land. Some of the
younger women are good-looking, and become the
picturesque costume of the country;—those curious little
black caps with silver ornaments and long black silk
tassels already described; jackets faced with silver lace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>or rows of metal buttons; belts similarly ornamented;
long flowing dark wadmal skirts of home manufacture;
and primitive shoes made of one bit of cow-skin or any
kind of hide, prepared so as in colour to resemble
parchment or the skin one sometimes sees stretched
like a drum-head over the mouth of a jar of honey.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few other ladies are in morning dress, with shawls
or handkerchiefs thrown gracefully over their heads,
and nothing peculiar or different in their costume from
what we are accustomed to see at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Haycock had received a letter of introduction to
Mr. Simson, and I had one to Mr. Sievertsen; the latter
is a retired merchant, and the former carries on a large
business of a very miscellaneous kind—such being the
character of all the stores or factories here. As the
houses of these gentlemen both lay in the same direction,
we set out together in order to obtain advice as to what
was to be seen in Reykjavik and its neighbourhood.
In passing along the front street, the stores—mostly
belonging to Danish merchants—presented quite a
bustling business aspect; while the dwelling houses,
with lattice windows, white curtains and flower-pots of
blooming roses and geraniums, exhibited an air of
<a id='tn52'></a>cleanliness, comfort and refinement. From the absence
of roads, carts are useless; one wheel barrow which we
saw, belonging to an enterprising storekeeper, we were
told, was the only wheeled vehicle in the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Sigurdur Sievertsen received us most cordially.
This intelligent old gentleman conducted Sir George
Mackenzie, who was his father’s guest, to the Geysers;
and he is alluded to by Sir George, in his travels, as
“young Mr. Sievertsen.” Time works changes! or, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Archbishop Whately would more accurately put it,
changes are wrought, not by, but “<i>in</i> time.” However,
Mr. Sievertsen is hale and hearty, and many summers
may he yet see! On the wall we saw the portrait of
his gifted and much lamented son, who several years
ago died in Paris. He had been taken there by Louis
Philip to receive a free education, as a graceful acknowledgment
to the Icelanders for kindness shewn to the
crew of a French vessel wrecked on their coast.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Our host has visited Britain, and both speaks and
writes English fluently. Neither he nor his amiable
wife spared any pains in trying to be of service to us.
They gave us all manner of information, and kindly
assisted us in procuring specimens of native manufacture,
such as—silver trinkets of beautiful workmanship; fine
knitted gloves soft as Angola wool; fishermen’s mits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>with no divisions for the fingers but each made with
two thumbs, so that when the fishing line wears through
one side the other can be turned; caps; men and women’s
shoes; quaint snuff boxes made of walrus tusk, or horn;
and sundry other souvenirs which we wished to take
south with us.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Mr. Simson’s store we saw everything from a
needle to an anchor; from the coarsest packsheet to
French ribbons. At Mr. Smith’s, whose son had come
north with us on his way from Copenhagen, we invested
in seal-skins and eider-down—the latter for pillows and
coverlets. This down, the eider-duck plucks from its
breast to line its nest; it and the eggs are taken away.
Again the nest is lined, and again robbed. The third
time, the drake repairs it, supplying the down; and if this
be also taken away the nest is altogether deserted by the
ill-used pair. One nest yields about two and a half
ounces of the finest clean down, or about half a pound
in all if removed three times. What is plucked from
the dead bird, it is said, possesses none of that wonderful
elasticity which constitutes the value of the other. We
should think, however, that this would depend on the
state of the plumage at the time. Many thousand pounds
weight of it are annually exported for quilts, pillows,
cushions, &#38;c. It sells in Iceland at from 10/6 to 17/6
per ℔. From three to four ℔s. are sufficient for a
coverlet, which, to be enjoyed in perfection, ought to be
used unquilted and loose like a feather bed. Quilting is
only useful where a small quantity of down is required
to go a long way; but, with three or four pounds at
command, there is no comparison in point of comfort
between loose and quilted—we have tried both. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>eider coverlet combines lightness and warmth in a degree
which cannot be otherwise obtained. With a single
sheet and blanket, it is sufficient for the coldest wintry
night. Its elasticity is proverbial; hence the Icelandic
conundrum we had propounded to us by our good friend
Mr. Jacobson, “What is it that is higher when the head
is taken off it?” <i>Answer</i>—“An eider-down pillow!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In walking along we saw some young ladies, in elegant
Parisian costume, out sunning themselves like butterflies.
The thermometer stood at 72°, so, light coloured fancy
parasols were in requisition and enjoyed no sinecure
to-day, even in Iceland. Single days here are sometimes
very bright and warm, though rarely without showers;
for the weather is very changeable, and summer short at
best. Less rain falls in the northern part of the island
than in the southern; because the mountains in the
south first catch and empty the rain clouds floating from
the south-west over the course of the gulf-stream. For
this reason there is more sunshine in the north, crops too
are heavier and earlier; for, notwithstanding the 3°
higher latitude, the summer temperature is nearly the
same as that of the south. In winter, however, it is
colder, from the presence of Spitzbergen icebergs and
Greenland ice-floes stranded on the shore, while the sea
to the north and east is filled with them. Last winter
was very severe: the south and west were also filled.
My friend Dr. Mackinlay has treated this subject—<a id='tn55'></a>the
climate of Iceland—so admirably, that I cannot
refrain from quoting his MS. notes:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The number and size of the rivers” says he, “cannot
fail to strike the attention of every visitor who sees much
of the country especially along the coasts. The main
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>cause of this is, of course, the abundant rain-fall which
is out of all proportion to the latitude of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This excess is owing to two causes—The mountainous
nature of the country; and its geographical position.
Iceland lies in the direct course of one of the branches
of the gulf-stream. No land intervenes between it and
the Bermudas. The rain-charged clouds from the south-west
are therefore ready to part with their moisture as
soon as they touch the shores of Iceland. As they move
northwards, to the back-bone of the island, their
temperature diminishes so rapidly that the whole of
their moisture becomes precipitated. Winds from the
S.W., S., and S.E., drench the southern part of the
Island, but bring fair weather to the north.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As the southernly winds are the most frequent, the
north side enjoys the greatest number of sunny days
in summer; and hence vegetation is more luxuriant
there, even though the latitude is 3° higher, and the
southernly winds are chilled in passing over the great
mountain chain. The mean summer temperature of the
north is almost as high as that of the south; but the
mean temperature of the year is 14° lower. In the south
this is 47°, but in the north it is 33°. The climate of
the south is insular in its character, while that of the
north is continental. Severe continuous frosts are rare
about Reykjavik; while along the north coast the
winters are very severe. The severity of the winters is
mainly caused by the presence of ice in the adjoining
seas. The cold Arctic current from Spitzbergen, which
impinges on the north coast, comes freighted in winter
with an occasional iceberg; while the westerly winds and
the west Icelandic branch of the gulf-stream combine to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>fill the seas to the north and east of the island with ice
floes from Greenland. In ordinary winters, the seas to
the south and east are open; but in extraordinary winters
they also are filled. Such a winter was that of 1858-9.
The corresponding winter in Britain was very mild, and
owed its mildness to the same cause which produced
the hard winter of Iceland—the unusual prevalence of
westerly winds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the first months of 1859, the sea between Greenland
and Iceland—200 miles wide—was packed with
ice floes; and upon these several bears made their way
across to Iceland. Floating ice surrounded the island;
but along the north coast the sea itself was frozen so far
out that the people of Grimsey, twenty miles or so from
the nearest point of Iceland, actually rode across to the
mainland. At Akur Eyri in the beginning of April,
Reaumur’s thermometer registered 26° of cold—a
temperature equal to 26½° of Fahrenheit. So late as
June, seven French fishing boats were lost in the ice on
the north coast, and a French ship of war nearly met
with the same fate. Speaking of northern ice, Captain
Launay, of the French man-of-war referred to, told me
that its approach could be foreseen at the distance of
twenty-five to thirty miles by a peculiar reflection of the
sky. As the distance diminishes, the sky gets overcast,
the temperature falls rapidly, and fish and sea-fowl
disappear. The Greenland ice is much more dangerous
than the Spitzbergen. The latter is 120 to 150 feet high,
massive and wall-sided, but of no great extent. The
former is in immense floes, often forming bays in which
ships are caught as in a snare. It seldom exceeds 40
feet in height; but is jagged and peaked. Sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>drift-timber gets nipped between the floes, and is set
fire to by the violent friction it sustains. The sound of
the crushing ice was described by Captain Launay as
most horrible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus much of the climate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Mackinlay took Mr. Haycock and me to call for
the Governor, the Count Von Trampe, who is a Dane,
and well known for his urbanity to strangers. He
kindly introduced us to his family. The house itself
resembles, and at once suggests pictures we have seen of
missionaries’ houses in Madagascar. Within doors,
however, all is tasteful and elegant. One peculiarity is
worth noting, viz.: that the walls of his suite of apartments
are covered with <i>French</i> portraits, paintings,
engravings, and lithographs, nearly all presentations.
In the public room, I only observed one that was not
French. Judging from the walls, we might have been
in the residence of a French Consul. French frigates are
put on this station, year after year, ostensibly to look after
the fisheries. Great court is paid to the leading islanders,
and France would fain be in the ascendant here as
elsewhere. Iceland, meanwhile, costs Denmark an outlay
of several thousands a year; because, say some of the
Icelanders, more is not invested in improvements of
various kinds in order to make it pay. This state of
matters would render negotiations easy on the part of
Denmark, were the acquisition of the island an object to
France. It would be an easy method of paying for
assistance rendered in any Holstein difficulty or other
cunningly laid European mine that may yet explode;
when the cause of justice and right, as it ever is, being
declared all on the side of France, she will disinterestedly
go forward with her eagles for freedom and glory.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Such contingencies may arise, although the Danes are
our natural allies and our Scandinavian brethren. It may
be asked, what would the French do with the island?
It would be chiefly useful to them for forming and
training hardy seamen for the navy, as they already do
to some extent both here and on the Newfoundland
coast where the fisheries are maintained and subsidized
for that very purpose. It would furnish a station in the
North Sea, from which to descend and menace our
North American traffic; and it contains extensive
sulphur mines, which, in the event of Sicily being shut
against us, are available for munitions of war in our
gunpowder manufactories; in another point of view, it
is invaluable, as the great salmon-preserve of Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Intelligent Icelanders who cherish the memory of
their ancient freedom, to my certain knowledge, regard
all such French tendencies and contingencies with
decided aversion. But in the event of a transfer being
mooted, would the Icelanders be consulted in the matter?
I fear not, and that it would only be announced to them
in the French fashion, as <i>fait accompli</i>: may such
however, never be the fate of this interesting island!</p>

<p class='c011'>These remarks, although suggested here by the
pictures in the Governor’s drawing-room, have no
reference, it is right to state, to the Count Von Trampe’s
views on this subject, which I do not happen to know;
nor on the other hand, to the officers’ of the vessels
stationed here, who all seem to be gentlemanly kind-hearted
fellows. A variety of facts and observations,
however, all tended to confirm me in this impression;
besides, it is the policy which the French are pursuing
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>From the Governor’s, we proceed to call for Mr.
Randröp, the states apothecary, and receive a most
hospitable, true, northern welcome. We meet several
French officers and see the usual quantum of French
prints on the walls. But he is the French consul or agent.
Coffee, cakes, and wine, are handed round to us <i>by the
ladies</i>, this being the custom of the country, and in drinking
to us, the form is always, “Welcome to Iceland.”
Mr. Randröp speaks a little English, and the two young
ladies, his step-daughters, are acquiring it. Here, as in
Germany, the class book in common use is “The Vicar
of Wakefield.” Madame Randröp, who speaks French
and German and plays on the piano-forte, shewed us
several beautiful silver trinkets, bracelets, pins, &#38;c., of
Icelandic manufacture; the style an open mediaeval
looking fretwork, that might satisfy the most <a id='tn60'></a>fastidious
artistic taste.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Governor’s house and Mr. Randröp’s are the two
centres of Reykjavik society, and at one or other of them,
of an evening, any stranger visiting these parts is almost
certain to be found. One is expected to make quite a
round of visits if he be authenticated, or have any sort of
introduction to any one of the circle; an omission would
even be regarded as a slight. Hence Dr. Mackinlay
took us to call for a considerable number of people, all of
whom were cordial and glad to see us.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our next visit was to the Rev. Olaf Pálsson, Dean and
Rector of the Cathedral. Learned, intelligent, communicative
and obliging, he at once, in the kindest manner
possible, placed himself at our service and offered us
every assistance in his power. In his library I observed
many standard works of reference in various languages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and opened several volumes that seemed to recognize me
as a friend whom they had met before: “Lord Dufferin’s
Letters from High Latitudes”—a presentation copy—“Caird’s
Sermons;” “Life of the Rev. Ebenezer
Henderson”—the Icelandic traveller; “Stanley’s Sinai
and Palestine,” &#38;c. The worthy pastor both speaks and
writes English fluently, and has translated a number of
Icelandic stories and fairy tales.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Pastor’s honest ruddy face, light flaxen hair, and
unassuming manner; his rosy cheeked children, the
monthly roses in the window-sill, and the library—all
go to form a pleasing picture in the Walhalla of memory.
He afterwards accompanied us to call for Rector Jonson.
The Rector is a good specimen of the genus homo; tall
and burly, while his active mind is vigorous, inquisitive,
and accomplished. He showed us over various rooms,
where the different branches are taught, some of them
containing cabinets of geological and zoological specimens.
The school is supported by government; and about sixty
select young men intended for the church and other
learned professions here receive a free education; a few
of them only go to Copenhagen yet further to complete
their studies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although the island contains 64,603 inhabitants, this,
as we have said, is the only Academy or College; and
there is not a single juvenile school.</p>

<p class='c011'>The population is so widely scattered that schools
would be quite impracticable; for the six thousand farms
which the island contains, on the habitable coast belt
which surrounds the central deserts, are often separated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>from each other by many dreary miles of lava wastes
and rapid rivers dangerous to ford.</p>

<p class='c011'>Parents, however, all teach their children to read and
write by the <a id='tn62'></a>fireside on the long winter evenings, as
they themselves were taught; and the people are thus
home educated from generation to generation, and
trained to habits of intellectual activity from their youth.
Thus, as a mass, the Icelanders are without doubt the
best educated people in the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>For six centuries the Icelanders have evidenced their
love of literature by writing and preserving old Sagas
and Eddas;—by producing original works on mythology,
law, topography, archaeology, &#38;c.—several of these at
once the earliest and best of their kind in Europe; and by
executing many admirable translations from the classics.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such literary labours have often been carried on by
priests in remote districts, who subsist on a miserable
pittance, and dwell in what we would consider mere
hovels,—men who are obliged to work, at outdoor manual
labour, the same as any of their neighbour peasants and
parishoners, in order to keep the wolf from the door.
Henderson found Thorláksson, the translator of “Paradise
Lost,” busy making hay. His living only yielded him
£7 per annum, and the one room in which he slept and
wrote was only eight feet long by six broad. This
translation was not printed till after his death. Verily
good work lovingly done is its own reward. These men
had little else to cheer them on.</p>

<p class='c011'>We next visited the Cathedral, which stands in the
back part of the town, with an open square space in front
of it, and a little fresh water lake—inland—to the left.
It is a modern edifice, built of brick, plastered. At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>entrance we were joined by our friend Professor Chadbourne.
The interior is very neatly fitted up with pews,
has galleries, organ, &#38;c.; and can accommodate three or
four hundred people.</p>

<p class='c011'>An oil painting above the communion table represents
the resurrection; but the only object of artistic interest
is a white marble baptismal font, carved and presented
to the Cathedral by Thorwaldsen, whose father was an
Icelander. It is a low square obelisk. The basin on the
top is surrounded with a symbolical wreath of passion-flowers
and roses, delicately carved in high relief out of
the white marble. On the front is represented, also in
relief, the baptism of our Saviour by St. John; on the
left side, the Madonna and Child, with John the Baptist
as an infant standing at her knee; on the right, Christ
blessing little children; while at the back, next the altar,
are three cherubs, and underneath them is inscribed the
following legend: “Opus haec Romae fecit, et Islandiae,
terrae sibi gentiliacae, pietatis causâ, donavit Albertus
Thorvaldsen, anno <span class='fss'>MDCCCXXVII</span>.” It is a chaste and
beautiful work of art.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the vestry the Rev. Olaf Pálsson opened several
large chests, and shewed us numerous vestments belonging
to the bishop and priests; one of these with gorgeous
embroideries had been sent here to the bishop by Pope
Julius II. in the beginning of the sixteenth century.
The cloth was purple velvet, embroidered and stiff with
brocade of gold.</p>

<p class='c011'>Above the church, immediately under the sloping roof,
an apartment runs the whole length of the building. In
it is deposited the free public library of Reykjavik, which
consists of more than 6000 volumes in Icelandic, Danish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Latin, French, English, German, and various other
languages. A copy of every book published at Copenhagen
is sent here by government, and from time to time
it receives numerous presentations from foreigners. The
ancient original Icelandic MSS. have all been removed
to Denmark, so that here there is now nothing very old
to be seen, except what has been reprinted. With great
interest we turned over the leaves of a copy of Snorre
Sturleson’s “Heimskringla,” and the “Landnáma Bok,”
shewn us by the librarian and learned scholar Mr. Jón
Arnason.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hotel at Reykjavik is merely a kind of tavern, with
a billiard room for the French sailors to play, lounge,
and smoke in; a large adjoining room, seated round,
for the Reykjavik fashionable assemblies; a smaller room
up stairs, and some two or three bedrooms. On reaching
it we were received by the landlord and shewn up
stairs, where we found Mr. Bushby, who gave us a most
courteous English welcome, notwithstanding our unintentional
intrusion. He had, that morning, when the
steamer came in sight, set out and ridden along the coast
from the sulphur mines at Krisuvik—perhaps one of the
wildest continuous rides in the world—to meet Captain
Forbes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Knowing the scant accommodation at the landlord’s
disposal, he at once placed the suite of rooms he had
engaged at our service, to dress and dine in, thus proving
himself a friend in need. A good <a id='tn64a'></a>substantial dinner
was soon under weigh, and rendered quite a success by
the many good things with which Mr. Bushby kindly
<a id='tn64b'></a>supplemented it, contributing them from his own private
stores.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Mr. Gísli Brynjúlfsson, the young Icelandic poet—employed
in antiquarian researches by the Danish
Government chiefly at Copenhagen, but at present here
because he is a member of the Althing or Parliament

Dr. Mackinlay. He speaks English fluently, and gave
us much interesting information. He kindly presented
me with a volume “Nordurfari,” edited by himself and
a friend, and containing amongst other articles in prose

<p class='c021'>After finally arranging with Zöga to start for the
Geysers at 8 o’clock next morning, Dr. Mackinlay, Mr.
Haycock, Professor Chadbourne and I took a walk through
the town, called for Dr. <a id='tn66d'></a>Hjaltalin, who unfortunately was
not at home, and strolled along to the <a id='tn66b'></a>churchyard. It is
surrounded by a low stone and turf wall. We gathered
forget-me-nots, catch-flies, saxifrage and <a id='tn66c'></a>butter-cups
among the grass; observed artificial flowers, rudely made
of muslin and worsted, stuck upon a grave, but do not
know if this is an Icelandic custom or the work of the
stranger over the last resting place of a comrade.</p>

<p class='c011'>Looking down upon Reykjavik from the elevation on
which we stand all is bright in the mellow glare of
evening; the windows of the houses gleam in the sun
like the great jewel of Ghiamsheed; the near Essian
mountains have a ruddy glow, and the bay, intensely
blue, is gay with vessels and flags.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gazing inland all is one wild dreary black lava waste—miles
upon miles of bog, stones and blocks of rock.
Botanized for an hour with the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>On returning saw several heaps of large cod-fish heads,
piled up near the sod-roofed houses of the fishermen in
the outskirts of the town. On enquiry we were told that
the heads of fish dried for exportation are thus retained;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the people here eat them, and one head is said to be a
good breakfast for a man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most of the houses in and around Reykjavik have little
plots of garden-ground surrounded with low turf walls.
In these we generally observed common vegetables such
as parsley, turnips, potatoes, cresses, a few plants for
salads, &#38;c.; here and there a currant bush, and sometimes
a few annuals or other flowers. These, however,
seldom come to any great degree of perfection, and are
often altogether destroyed; for the climate is severe and
very changeable, especially in the southern portion of the
island.</p>

  <h2 id='ch3' class='c010'><span class='xxlarge'>RIDE TO THE GEYSERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Friday morning, July 29.</i> Landed from the
steamer between 7 and 8 o’clock, and found the baggage
and riding horses with the relays, twenty-four in all,
assembled at the hotel court; Zöga the guide, with his
brother and a boy who were also to accompany us, busy
adjusting saddles, stirrup straps, &#38;c. For four days we
shall be thrown entirely upon our own resources, so that
provisions, tent, plaids and everything we are likely to
need during a wilderness journey, must be taken with
us. Our traps had been sent on shore late on the
previous evening. The mode of loading the sumpter
ponies is peculiar; a square piece of dried sod is placed
on the horses back, then a wooden saddle with several
projecting pins is girded on with rough woollen ropes; to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>either side of the saddle, is hooked on, a strong oblong
wooden box generally painted red; while on the pins are
hung bags, bundles, and all sorts of gipsy looking gear.
These need frequent re-adjustment from time to time
as the ponies trot along, one side will weigh up the
other, or the animals get jammed together and knock
their loads out of equilibrium, the saddles then perhaps
turn round and articles fall rattling to the ground. The
strong little boxes are constructed and other arrangements
made with a view to such contingencies, and
however primitive, rude, or outlandish they may at first
seem to the stranger, he will soon come to see the why
and the wherefore, and confess their singular adaptation
to the strange and unique exigences of Icelandic travel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The baggage train at length moved off, accompanied
by the relief ponies, which were tied together in a row,
the head of the one to the tail of the other before it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Mackinlay, Mr. Bushby, Mr. Sievertsen, and
other acquaintances came to see us start. Equipped
with waterproofs and wearing caps or wide-awakes, no
two of us alike, at half-past eight o’clock, a long straggling
line of non-descript banditti-looking cavaliers, all
in excellent spirits and laughing <a id='tn70'></a>at each other’s odd
appearance, we rode at a good pace out of Reykjavik.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rarely it occurs that any of us makes this journey
on which I go,”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> words spoken to Dante by his guide,
in the ninth Canto of the <i>Inferno</i>, forcibly suggested
themselves to me as I “entered on the arduous and
savage way,” and gazed around on the “desert strand.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The road terminated when we reached the outskirts
of the town, and the track lay over a wild black stony
waste with little or no vegetation; everything seemed
scorched. The relay ponies were now loosed from each
other, and, perfectly free, driven before us like</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“A wild and wanton herd,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is the hot condition of their blood.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>They were apt to scatter in quest of herbage, but Zöga,
when his call was not enough or the dogs negligent,
quickly out-flanked the stragglers, upon which, they,
possessed by a salutary fear of his whip, speedily rejoined
their fellows.</p>

<p class='c011'>We soon lost sight of the sea, and in a short time
came to the Lax-elv—or salmon river—which we forded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Enormous quantities of fish are taken at the wears a
little higher up where there are two channels and an
arrangement for running the water off, first from the one
and then from the other, leaving the throng of fishes
nearly dry in a little pool from which they are readily
taken by the hand. The fishermen wear rough woollen
mittens to prevent the smooth lithe fish from slipping
through their fingers when seizing them by head and
tail, to throw them on shore. From five hundred to a
thousand fishes are sometimes taken in a day. The
fishery is managed by an intelligent Scotchman sent
here by a merchant in Peterhead who leases the stream
and has an establishment of some fifteen tin-smiths
constantly at work making cans for “preserved salmon.”
The fish are cut into pieces, slightly boiled—then soldered
and hermetically sealed up in these tin cases containing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>say 2 or 4 ℔s. each, and sent south packed in large
hogsheads to be distributed thence over the whole world.</p>

<p class='c011'>The few grass-farms we saw were like hovels;
many separate erections, stone next the ground, the gable
wood, and the roof covered with green sod. The rafters
are generally made of drift wood or whale’s ribs. Turf
is used as fuel; but in common Icelandic houses there is
only one fire—that in the kitchen—all the year round.
The beds are often mere boxes ranged around the
room, or, where there is such accommodation, underneath
the roof round the upper apartment, which is approached
by a trap-stair. They are filled with sea-weed or feathers
and a cloth spread over them. In the farm houses we
entered there was a sad want of light and fresh air; in
fact, these sleeping rooms were so close and stifling that
we were glad to descend and rush out to the open air
for breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little bit of pet pasture land, round each farm,
enclosed by a low turf wall, is called “tun,” a word still
used in rural districts of Scotland—spelt toon, or town—with
the same sound and similar signification.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rode many miles through wild black desolate dreary
volcanic wastes—no near sounds but the metallic bicker
of our ponies’ hoofs over the dry rocks and stones, or
fearless splashing through mud puddles—and no distant
sounds save the <i>eerie</i> cries, tremulous whistlings and
plaintive wails of the curlew, plover, and snipe. Observed
the abrasions of the ice-drift very distinctly traced on
the rocks, these all running nearly south-west. The
slightly elevated rock-surface was frequently polished
quite smooth, scratches here and there showing the
direction of the friction by which this appearance had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>been produced. In some instances the rock was left
bare, in others detached stone blocks of a different
formation rested on the surface.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wild geranium, saxifrage, sedum, and tufts of sea-pink
are very common, when we come to anything green.
The wild geranium, from the almost nightless summer
of the north, is six times larger than in Britain, and
about the size of a half-penny.</p>

<div id='fig_020'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>RAVINE.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Came to a deep ravine, wild, horrid, and frightful;
rode along the edge of it, and then through dreadfully
rough places, with nothing to mark the track; amidst
great and little blocks of stone—trap, basalt, and lava—mud-puddles—up-hill,
down-hill, fording rivers, and
through seemingly impassible places; yet the Icelandic
horse goes unflinchingly at it. Mr. Haycock says it
would be sheer madness to attempt such break-neck
places in England; there, no horse would look at it;
steeple-chasing nothing to it. His horse was repeatedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>up to the girths in clayey mud, and recovered itself
notwithstanding its load as if it were nothing to pause
about. Truly these are wonderful animals, they know
their work and do it well.</p>

<p class='c011'>Came to a grassy plot, in a hollow by a river’s side,
where we halted, changed the saddles and bridles to the
relief ponies, and, clad in mackintosh, thankfully sat
down on the wet grass to rest, while we ate a biscuit
and drank of the stream. In the course of the day, we
had come to several green spots, like oasis in the black
desert, where the horses rested for a short time to have
a feed of grass.</p>

<p class='c011'>After starting, ascended for about an hour through a
ravine, where we saw some lovely little glades full of
<i>blae-berries</i>—sloe,—low brushwood, chiefly of willows
and birch, and a profusion of flowers, such as wild
geranium, thyme, dog-daisy, saxifrage, sea-pink, catch-fly,
butter-cup, a little white starry flower, and <i>diapensia</i>;
the latter is found, here and there, in round
detached patches of fresh green like a pincushion, gaily
patterned with little pink flowers. I am indebted to
Professor Chadbourne for the name of it. Obtained a
root of this plant for home, and gathered flowers of the
others to preserve.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now came to an elevated plateau which stretched
away—a dreary stony moor—bounded in one direction by
the horizon-line and in another by hills of a dark brown
colour. Here there was not a patch of verdure to be
seen; all one black desert lava-waste strewn with large
boulders and angular slabs, lying about in all conceivable
positions. In riding, one required to keep the feet in
constant motion, to avoid contact with projecting stones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>as the ponies picked their way among them. Our feet
consequently were as often out of the stirrups as in them.
Shakspere says “Wisely and slow, they stumble that
run fast;” not so, however, with the sure footed Icelandic
ponies; for, even over such ground, they trotted at a
good pace and no accident befell us.</p>

<p class='c011'>I generally rode first with Zöga the guide, or last with
Professor Chadbourne. The driving of the relief horses
before us, like a stampedo, and the keeping of them
together afforded some of us much amusement as we
rode along. Here no sheep or cattle could live. It was
literally “a waste and howling wilderness.” We saw
several snow-birds and terns flying about, and often
heard the <i>eerie</i> plaintive whistle of the golden plover.
These birds were very tame and examined us with
evident curiosity. They would perch on a large lava
block before us, quite close to our track, and sit till we
came up and passed—then fly on before, to another block,
and sit there gazing in wonder; and so on for miles.
They had evidently never been fired at. Mr. Murray
humanely remarked that it would be murder to shoot
them! In this black stony plateau there was often not the
least vestige of a track discernible; but we were kept in
the right direction by cairns of black stones placed here
and there on slight elevations. These guiding marks—“varder”
as they are called—are yet more needed when
all the surface is covered with snow; then, “vexed with
tempest loud,” Iceland must resemble Milton’s description
of Chaos.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'>“Far off,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dark, waste and wild under the frown of night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Starless exposed and ever threatening storms</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Chaos blustering round.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>We saw one rude house of refuge, without any roof,
built of lava blocks, in the midst of this black desert
where everything seemed blasted. Came now on spots
where a few tufts of <a id='tn76'></a>sea-pinks, and many bright coloured
wild-flowers were springing up among the stones. Saw
flat rock-surfaces shrivelled up and wrinkled like pitch,
an effect which had evidently been produced when the
lava was cooling; others were ground down and polished
smooth in grooves by the ice-drift. As near as I can
calculate, some fourteen or fifteen miles of our journey
lay over this one long long dreary stony waste, henceforth,
ever to be associated in memory with the plover’s
wild lone plaintive tremulous whistle.</p>

<p class='c011'>At 3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we came in sight of the blue lake of Thingvalla,<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
lying peacefully in the valley before us; while the
range of the hills beyond it, bare, bold and striking in
their outline, was mostly of a deep violet colour.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the day, arrowy showers of drenching rain
“cold and heavy,” like that described by Dante in the
third circle of the <i>Inferno</i>, or wet drizzling mists had
alternated with gleams of bright clear sunshine.
Towards the afternoon the weather had become more
settled and the effect of the prospect now before us,
although truly lovely in itself, was heightened by our
previous monotonous though rough ride over the dreary
stony plateau. The lake far below us, with its two
little volcanic islands Sandey and Nesey, lay gleaming
in the sun like a silver mirror; while the wild scenery
around forcibly reminded us of Switzerland or Italy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thingvalla was to be our resting place for the night,
and seeing our destination so near at hand in the valley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>below us, some one purposed a rapid scamper, that we
might the sooner rest, eat, and afterwards have more
leisure to explore the wondrous features of the place.
Forthwith we set off at a good pace, but the Professor
was too tired to keep up with us, so I at once fell
behind to bear him company. The others were speedily
out of sight. Knowing that dinner preparations would
occupy Zöga for some time after his arrival, we rode
leisurely along, admiring the green level plain far below
us. When wondering how we were to get down to it, we
suddenly and unexpectedly came to a yawning chasm or
rent running down through the edge of the plateau. It
seemed about 100 feet deep, 100 feet wide, and was partially
filled with enormous blocks of basalt which had
toppled down from either side; where more, cracked and
dissevered, still impended, as if they might fall with a
crash at the slightest noise or touch. This was the
celebrated Almanna Gjá or Chasm, of which we had
read so much but of which we had been able to form no
adequate idea from descriptions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of a scene so extraordinary, indeed unique, I can only
attempt faithfully to convey my own impressions, without
hoping to succeed better than others who have gone
before me.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let the reader imagine himself, standing on the stony
plateau; below him stretches a beautiful verdant valley,
say about five miles broad, and about 100 feet below
the level on which he is standing; to the right before him
also lies the lake which we have been skirting for some
miles in riding along. It is in size about ten miles each
way, and is bounded by picturesque ranges of bare
volcanic hills. This whole valley has evidently sunk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>down in one mass to its present level, leaving exposed a
section of the rent rocks on either side of the vale.
These exposed edges of the stony plateau running in
irregular basaltic strata, and with fantastic shapes on the
top like chimneys and ruined towers, stretch away like
black ramparts for miles, nearly parallel to each other,
with the whole valley between them, and are precipitous
as walls, especially that on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>The top of the mural precipice, overlooking the gorge
at our feet, is the original uniform level of the ground
before the sinking of the valley. It forms the edge of
the plateau which stretches away behind and also before
us to the left of the precipice; for we look down the
chasm lengthways, along the front of the rock-wall, and
not at right angles from it. A mere slice of the rock
has been severed and is piled up on our right, like a
Cyclopian wall. It runs parallel with the face of the
rent rock to which it formerly belonged, for, say, about
the eighth of a mile N.E. from where we stand, and then
terminates abruptly there in irregular crumbling blocks
like a heap of ruins; while the trench or gjá itself also
runs back in a straight line S.W. for about two miles,
and terminates at the brink of the lake.</p>

<p class='c011'>The N.E. side of the valley is the highest, and the
S.W. the lowest—shelving beneath the blue water, and
forming the bottom of the lake. The river <a id='tn78'></a>Oxerá, which
thunders over the rock-wall on the right, forms a magnificent
waterfall, and then flows peacefully across the
south-west corner of the valley to the lake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between these two rock-walls—the left forming the real
boundary of the valley on that side, but the right wall
being only a slice severed from the left, and not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>other boundary of the valley, which is situated about
five miles distant—a long narrow passage descends,
leading to the plain below. The flat bottom of this
passage 100 feet deep is strewn with debris, but otherwise
covered with tender green sward. The bottom is
reached from the elevated waste where we stand by a
very rough irregular winding incline plane—for although
the descent is full of great blocks of stones, dreadfully
steep, and liker a deranged staircase than anything else,
we still call it a steep incline plane from the level of the
plateau to the passage beneath which leads into the
valley—high rock-walls rising on either side as we
descend. Entering the defile and moving along on level
ground, the wall on the right, evidently rent from the
other side as if sliced down with some giant’s sword
from the edge of the plateau, soon terminates in the
valley; but that on the left runs on for many miles like
a fire-scathed rampart. The stony plateau stretches
back from the edge or level of the summit of this rock-wall,
and the lovely green valley of Thingvalla extends
from its base to the Hrafna Gjá or Raven’s Chasm—the
corresponding wall and fissure, like rampart and fosse—which
bounds the other side of the valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am thus particular, because certain descriptions led
me to suppose that here we would encounter a precipice
at right angles to our path, and have to descend the face
of it, instead of descending an incline <i>parallel to its face</i>,
from where the <i>stair</i> begins on the old level. As it is,
however, it seemed quite steep enough, with the rock-walled
incline reaching from the valley to our feet.
This wild chasm is called the Almanna Gjá—all men’s or
main chasm; while the one on the other side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>vale of Thingvalla is called the Hrafna Gjá or Raven’s
Chasm. The whole character of the scene, whether
viewed by the mere tourist, or dwelt upon by the man
of science, is intensely interesting, and in several
respects quite unique; hence I have tried to describe it
so minutely.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Professor Chadbourne and I came up to it, we
gazed down in awe and wonder. We knew that our
companions must have descended somehow, for there
was no other way: but how, we could not tell. Were we
to dismount and let the horses go first, they might
escape and leave us; if we attempted to lead them down
they might fall on the top of us; to descend on foot
would be extremely difficult at any time, and dismounting
and mounting again at this stage of our proceedings,
was rather a formidable undertaking. “How shall we
set about it?” I asked my friend. “You may do as you
please,” said he, “but I must keep my seat if I can.”
“So shall I, for the horse is surer footed than I can
hope to be to-day.” “Lead on then” said the Professor,
“and I’ll follow!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So leaving my pony to choose its steps, it slowly
picked its way down the steep gorge; zig-zagging from
point to point and crag to crag, or stepping from one
great block of stone to another. I was repeatedly
compelled to lean back, touching the pony’s tail with
the back of my head, in order to maintain the perpendicular,
and avoid being shot forward, feet first, over its
head, among the rocks. Sometimes at steep places it
drew up its hind legs and slid down on its hams, many
loose stones rattling down along with us as the pony
kicked out right and left to keep its balance, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>made the sparks fly from its heels. Descending in
silence, at last we reached the bottom in safety, thinking
it rather a wild adventure in the way of riding, and one
not to be attempted elsewhere.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Looking back with awe and increasing wonder at the
gorge we had descended, for it certainly was terrifically
steep, we both remarked the cool indifference and utter
absence of fear with which we had ridden down such
a break-neck place. The fresh air and excitement prevent
one from thinking anything about such adventures
till they are over.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The high rock-walls, now hemming us in on either side,
bore a considerable resemblance to the pictures of Petra—Wady
Mousa—in Arabia, and here we could fancy
mounted Bedouins riding up with their long matchlocks.
All was silent as the grave. The ground was green with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>tender herbage; great blocks of stone lay about, and
others seemed ready to topple over and fall down upon us.
Riding along, the rocks on the right soon terminated
like a gigantic heap of burned ruins, and allowed us to
gaze across the vale of Thingvalla, with the river <a id='tn82b'></a>Oxerá
in the foreground. Here we overtook our friends who
told us that they had all dismounted and led their horses
down the chasm, and would scarcely believe that we had
ridden down. All of us were lost in wonder and struck
with awe at the scenes we had witnessed. We forded
the river in a row, following Zöga’s guidance; and at 5
o’clock in the afternoon rode up to the priest’s house
on the other side. It was simply a farm, like others
we had seen, consisting of a group of separate erections
with wooden gables, green sod on the roof and
the whole surrounded with a low stone wall coped with
turf. Beside it was the silent churchyard with its
simple grassy graves of all sizes. Immediately behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the house were piles of sawn timber, and several
carpenters at work rebuilding the little church, which
having become old and frail had been taken down.
Its site was only about 25 feet by 10.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Zöga went in to tell the pastor of our arrival, leaving
us to dismount in a deep miry lane between two rough
stone walls leading to the house. He had been busy
with his hay, but speedily appeared and hospitably
offered us what shelter he could afford.</p>

<p class='c011'>Zöga arranged for the grazing of the ponies; we were
to dine in the largest room of the house, and he was
to have the use of the kitchen fire to cook our dinner—the
preserved meats, soups, &#38;c.—which of course we had
brought with us. The pastor provided a splendid trout
from the river, to the great delectation of half a dozen
travellers all as hungry as hawks.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>PRIEST’S HOUSE AT THINGVALLA.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Now commenced the unstrapping and unpacking,
presided over by the indefatigable Zöga; boxes, bags,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and packages, bespattered with mud, lay about singly
and in piles. Everybody seemed to want something or
other which was stowed away somewhere, and forthwith
the patient obliging Zöga, in a most miraculous manner,
never failed to produce the desiderated articles. Taking
a rough towel and soap, I performed my ablutions in the
river close by, while dinner was getting ready and felt
quite refreshed. “Time and the hour runs through the
roughest day,” and this was certainly one to be marked
in our calender. Shortly after 6 o’clock we dined and
attempted some conversation in Latin with the priest, Mr.
S. D. Beck. He is a pastor literally and metaphorically,
farming and fishing as well as preaching. Hay, however,
is the only crop which is raised here; and the Icelanders
are consequently very dependent upon the hay-harvest.
With their short summer they might not inappropriately
quote <a id='tn84'></a>Shakspere’s lines,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The sun shines hot; and if we use delay</div>
      <div class='line'>Cold biting winter mars our hoped for hay.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The scythe used by the Icelanders is quite straight and
not half the length of ours. The numerous little
hummocks, with which pasture land is covered, necessitate
the use of a short implement, so that it may mow
between and around them; the hillocks are from one to
two feet high, and from one to four feet across. In
some places the ground presents quite the appearance of
a churchyard or an old battle-field. These elevations are
occasioned by the winter’s frost acting on the wet
subsoil. If levelled they would rise again to the same
height in about 7 or 8 years; but the farmers let them
alone, because they fancy they get a larger crop from the
greater superficial area of the field, and this old let-alone
custom certainly saves them much labour. The primitive
state of their agriculture, as well as the peculiar
nature of the Icelandic soil, may be inferred from the
fact, that there are only two ploughs in the whole island
and no carts. A spade, a scythe two feet long, a small
rake with teeth about an inch and a half deep, and ropes
made of grass or hair to bind the hay, which is carried
on men’s backs or conveyed by horses to be stacked, are
all that the farmer requires for his simple operations.
The hay, especially that which grows in the <a id='tn85'></a>túns, is of
fine quality, tender and nutritive; and, with even any
ordinary attention to drainage, many a fertile vale could
be made to yield much more than is now obtained from
it. Latin was our only mode of communicating directly
with the priest; but having had little colloquial practice
of that kind, we blundered on, feeling that, in appropriating
the stately language of Cicero and Virgil to creature
comforts and the vulgar ongoings of daily life, we were
almost committing a species of desecration: yet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>ludicrous combinations and circumlocutions, grasped at
in desperation to express modern things in a dead
language, afforded us no little amusement. Professor
Chadbourne, Mr. Murray, and myself got most of the
work to do, and were often greeted with the pastor’s
goodnatured “Ita,” or “Intelligo,” when our propositions
could not have been particularly remarkable
for perspicacity. Amongst foreigners, charity covers a
multitude of sins of this kind. We cannot however
apply the same remark to our own countrymen, who are
often more inclined to laugh at a foreigner’s mistakes
than to help him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fragrant tedded hay and the green vale of
Thingvalla stretching before us were peculiarly refreshing
to the eye, after the dreary rugged lava-wastes
through which we had passed—where tracks of flat rocks
were corrugated and shrivelled up like pitch, having
been left so when the lava set; and where other rock-surfaces
appeared ground and polished in grooves by the
ice-drift; or where all was covered with a pack of lava
blocks and slabs, of all sizes and lying in every
conceivable direction<a id='tn86'></a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>After tea I walked out alone a little way north-west
of the church to examine the Althing, on the upper part
of which stands the Lögberg or sacred law hill, where,
when the Parliament or Althing was assembled, the
judges sat; and where justice was administered to the
Icelanders for nearly 900 years; thus rendering Thingvalla,
with its numerous associations and stirring
memories, to speak historically, by far the most interesting
spot in the island.</p>

<div id='fig_025'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>ALTHING AND LÖGBERG FROM BEHIND THE CHURCH.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Althing is a long sloping ridge of lava, about 200
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>feet long and from 30 to 50 broad, covered on the top
with the most tender herbage and flowers. At the end
next the church it is low and approachable, by climbing
over a few stones among and below which one can see
water, but it is entirely separated from the surrounding
plain by two deep perpendicular rocky fissures or chasms
running parallel on either side and joining at the further
end. Only at one place is the chasm so narrow—16 feet—that,
once on a time, Flosi, leader of the burners of
Njal’s house, made his escape from justice by taking a
desperate leap. These chasms contain clear water, so
that the Althing is in fact a narrow peninsula, which
with the entrance guarded was as secure as a fortress.
One looks sheer down, say 20 or 30 feet, to the surface
of the water in the chasms; while the water itself is from
80 to 90 feet deep, and in some places said to be unfathomable.
These fissures run S.W. to the lake which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>is about a mile distant. Through the water, one sees
huge blocks of lava of a whitish blue colour and dark
masses of basalt gleaming from the green depths.
Beautiful tender fairy-like ferns grow on the edges and
in the sheltered crevices of the rocks; and I gathered
specimens of grasses, mosses, violets, butter-cups and forget-me-nots,
from the soft verdant carpet which covered
the surface. Here, the Icelandic Parliament, such as it
was, continued to meet, down to the year 1800, when
the seat of government was finally removed to Reykjavik.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the old palmy days, prior to <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1261 when the
island became subject to Norway, the Althing was the
scene of many a spirited debate; affairs of the greatest
import were here freely discussed, and finally disposed
of, in open assembly. Thus, in the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1000, after
a stormy debate, it was determined that Christianity
should be introduced as the religion of the island. Here,
measures of general interest were proposed, taxes levied,
law-suits conducted, the judgments of inferior courts
revised, subordinate magistrates impeached for dereliction
of duty and dismissed from their office; while criminals
were tried, and if found guilty of capital offences
were summarily executed. Criminals were beheaded
on the little Island of Thorlevsholm in the Oxerá; in a
pool of the same river, female offenders, sewed in a sack,
were drowned; and those condemned for witchcraft were
precipitated from the top of a high rock on the east side
of the Almannagjá.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Althing commonly met in the middle of May
and sat for 14 days. Every freeholder had a right to
attend and express his opinion on measures under
consideration: thus, at Thingvalla, friends and acquaintances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>from distant parts of the island—members and
friends of both sexes—annually availed themselves of
this opportunity of meeting each other. The people
pitched their tents on the banks of the Oxerá and in
the plain around the Althing; so that a wild lone scene
usually silent as the grave, for the time became quite
a busy one, enlivened by the presence of nearly all the
elite of the island.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>LAKE OF THINGVALLA FROM THE LÖGBERG.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Gazing from the Althing, so as to take in the general
aspect of the wondrous scene around us, the whole
valley seems obviously to have sunk down en masse to
its present level. The tops of the two extreme wall-like
boundaries, with chasms at their base, on either side of
the vale, respectively called the Almannagjá and the
Hrafnagjá, show the original height of the whole, and
also exhibit a section of the rock. This view of the
matter is proved by the fact, that the numerous cracks,
rents, or fissures, such as those around the Althing, with
which the valley is intersected, when examined are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>found exactly to correspond in their sections—trahytic
trap capped by lava—with the edges left standing as they
were before the subsidence of the valley and now
bounding it like a black rampart. The pastor’s dwelling,
from where I stand, presents the appearance of a few
grass hillocks or potato-pits. The site of each erection
is partly excavated from the side of a little slope, to protect
it from the storm. Grass-turf covers the roofs, and
the whole group of buildings is surrounded by a three-foot
turf-wall; consequently, like many other Icelandic
farms we have seen, little more than the roofs appear
above ground. At midnight I made several sketches of
the lake of Thingvalla; the river Oxerá as it fell
thundering over the dark rock-wall in a sheet of white
foam; and the bare heights to the north-east, purple in
the evening glow and mottled with snow patches.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>On returning to the pastor’s, I found my companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>fast asleep on the floor. The canvas tent which had been
left by the French expedition served them for a bed,
portmanteaus or packages were appropriated for pillows,
and plaids and wrappers spread over them for blankets.
They lay packed like herrings in a barrel. I stepped over
them as quietly as I could, found an unoccupied space
near the open window, speedily ensconced myself for the
night, and in a few minutes sank into a well-earned and
blessed state of obliviousness.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Saturday Morning, July 30.</i>—Breakfasted and left
Thingvalla at 9 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> The first five miles or so of our
journey across the valley lay through low green brushwood,
where the vegetation was fresh and luxuriant. This
in Iceland is called a forest; but the trees, chiefly birches
and willows, are all dwarfs. The birches were about 3
feet high, very few of them attaining to the height of 4
or 5 feet; the willows were of three kinds; one with a
leaf resembling bog myrtle; the leaves of another white,
green, and flossy—both these varieties only 10 to 12 inches
high; while the third, although Professor Chadbourne
assured me it was a genuine willow, was only about one
and a half inches; we observed catkins on them all.
Wild geraniums, forget-me-nots, butter-cups, the beautiful
rose-coloured sedum so common in Iceland, clover,
sea-pinks, &#38;c., grew in profusion, and imparted to the
whole the appearance of a rich fresh green coppice.
When the ponies could snatch at a stray bite of grass
as they passed along, in doing so, they would often at
the same time take up a tree by the roots and carry it
off in their mouths.</p>

<p class='c011'>We came upon yawning chasms, every little way,
where the rocks had been rent asunder; the cracks or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>fissures about 100 feet deep, 10 or 20 wide, dry, and all
running in the same direction from the lake. These we
either avoided, or crossed at places where blocks of
stone had fallen in, so as to fill up part with debris, or
form natural bridges which afforded as good footing as
the most of the track we had ridden over. The lake of
Thingvalla lay peacefully behind us on our right, fair as
a silver mirror. Ascending a green bosky hill, where
numerous hillocks around were clothed with low brushwood
to the very top, we came to the Hrafnagjá, or
Raven’s chasm, which forms the eastern boundary of
Thingvalla. It is a deep broad irregular abyss, several
miles in length, and on the further side, high like a
rampart. We got across it, and up to the level of the
plateau, by picking our way over the ridge of an avalanche
of rock and stones, which had fallen in, leaving
gaps, rude arches, and frightful openings into the darkness
beneath us; while, right and left, the chasm itself
stretched away like the dry fosse of a giant’s castle which,
through successive ages, had withstood the assaults of all
the rock-jötuns. Up this perilous way, steeper than a
stair, winding, zig-zagging, doubling, leaping like cats
from block to block, or standing for a second like goats
with four feet on one stone to consider their next move,
our patient ponies toiled upwards and took us safely
across. Looking back, we bade adieu for a time to
the lovely green vale of Thingvalla beneath us, and
were lost in wonder, both at the wild savage grandeur
of the chasm we had just crossed and at the sure-footedness
and pluck of our trusty little steeds.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plateau now attained was of the same level as
that over which we had passed before descending into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Thingvalla, but here, it did not extend very far, being
bounded by irregular heights and bare hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vegetation disappeared, everything seemed blasted.
Plovers again sat quite close to us, or flitted past,
uttering their shrill plaintive whistle; passing so near
that we could distinctly observe the tremulous motion
of their mandibles. The ponies stepped aside from holes
in our very track, opening into hollow darkness, where
stones thrown in were long heard striking against the
sides. At one place, we came to a black cave 20 or 30
feet in size, arched right into and under great blocks of
stone. It appeared to be a huge lava-blister which had
taken its present shape in cooling. The bottom of the
cave, protected from the warm rays of the sun, was
covered with snow; and, for the same reason, white
patches of snow lay in crevices of the bare rocky hills
around us. The path now ascended flanking the sides
of the hills on the left, while the whole region seemed
fire-scathed and blasted. The hills and slopes were
covered with dark volcanic sand, pulverized ashes, and
slag, out of which abruptly rose irregular masses of rock.
Here, leaving our horses, we turned aside to examine a
small extinct crater or vent, called Tintron, crowning a
little eminence to the right. In ascending it, we were
up to the ancles in fine black sand or slag, which,
yielding beneath the feet at every step, made walking
extremely awkward, if not difficult. The crater itself
was composed of great blocks of red and black vitrified
lava, over which we looked down into the darkness
as into Pluto’s chimney. We threw in some large
stones, but could not from their sound form an estimate
of the depth. Perhaps this vent may be only a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>lava-blister which has burst on the top, instead of
forming a cave like the other we lately saw. However,
though small, it presented the appearance of a regular
crater. From it, we saw, on the one side, the beautiful
Lake of Thingvalla; and, on the other, the near hills
opposite, with the slope between them and us all
covered with black scoriæ.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>VENT OF TINTRON.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>After pocketing a few specimens of the lava, I made a
rough sketch of the crater and gathered a sprig of wild
thyme, and a little white flower (<i>parnassia</i>), which was
blooming all alone on its very brink. Mounting our
ponies and descending for about an hour, on clearing
the <a id='tn94'></a>hill-side we came in sight of a level plain of green
meadow land, lying below us, shaped like a horse shoe,
and occupying an area of 3 or 4 miles. It appeared to
have been submerged at no very distant period, and, like
other Icelandic valleys, was sadly in want of drainage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rocky hill-range, which at the same time came into
view on the left and formed the boundary of the plain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>was one of the most singular I ever beheld. It was
composed of black, yellow, and red volcanic rock; rising
in fantastic cones, or receding into savage gorges, steep,
abrupt, and angular. The surface was absolutely without
vegetation of any kind, and every cleavage, rent or
crevice, so fresh, bare, and unweathered, one could fancy
that the rocks had only during the last hour been
smitten, shattered, and splintered by Thor’s hammer;
while the rich effect of their vari-coloured tints was
heightened by the pure white clouds which incense-like
were now muffling and rolling about their summits, and
by the verdure which extended to their base like a carpet.
Our track lay along the foot of them, and wonder only
increased as we obtained a nearer view of their Tartarian
wildness.</p>

<div id='fig_029'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>VARI-COLOURED HILLS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Here we halted, and I made a slight sketch of a portion
of the range. As a mere study of light and shade,
to say nothing of other striking features, the scene would
have made a magnificent photograph.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Starting, we rode on, till we reached the end of the
cinder range, doubled the outmost spur, and, after
ascending for sometime, came in sight of gently sloping
hills. Their flowing outlines were covered with verdure
to the very top, and, from our path, opened up here and
there into little green bosky valleys “where the blae-berries
grow.” Before us, in a vast level plain which
stretched away from the roots of the hills near to the
horizon, lay the <a id='tn96a'></a>Laugervatn; and further to the south,
linked by a river, the <a id='tn96b'></a>Apavatn, a lake much larger;
while several other rivers meandered in gleaming serpentine
courses over the vast green prairie-like meadow.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the brink of the <a id='tn96c'></a>Laugervatn are several hot
springs from which it takes its name. We observed
columns of white steam rising from them on the brink
next us, just below the farm of Laugervalla; and also
across on the other side of the lake. Approaching the
farm, we halted, outside the tun, to lunch, rest for an
hour and let the horses graze. It presented the usual
appearance of Icelandic farms; not unlike an irregular
group of potato-pits or tumuli. The roofs were of the same
colour as the plain, and the whole shut in from the
surrounding pasture land by a rude four-foot wall, also
covered on the top with green turf. The tun, or few acres
thus enclosed, receives a top-dressing of manure and
bears a luxuriant crop of hay; the rest is left in a state
of nature, and reaped without sowing. The hay, when
stacked, is protected from the rain by thin slices or
strips of turf from 6 to 10 feet long. Nearly all Icelandic
farming has reference to the rearing of stock—the
summer being too short for grain to reach maturity.</p>

<hr class='c023'>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>A few words, here, while we rest, as to Icelandic
Farms in general.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most farms have a weaving room, a smithy, a milk
room, a sitting room—used also for eating and sleeping in—called
stofa; a guest-chamber, cattle-houses, which are
sometimes placed immediately under the sleeping-room
but more frequently detached, and a kitchen; which last
my friend Dr. Mackinlay neatly describes as often “a
dingy dark place, with a peat fire on a lava block, and a
hole in the roof to let in light and let out smoke.” The
turf is inferior; wood is too scarce and valuable to be
much used for fuel. Coal costs £5 per ton, is retailed in
small packages at about 2d. per pound, and is only used
in smithies. When turf is not available, the Icelanders,
like the Arabs, burn dried cows’ dung; and on the coast,
where even that is scarce, they use the dried carcases of
sea-fowl. Why do they not burn dried sea-weed, which
is extensively used for fuel in the Channel Islands?</p>

<p class='c011'>Their daily food is taken cold, and consists chiefly of
raw dried <a id='tn97'></a>stock-fish and skier. The latter dish is simply
milk allowed to become acid and coagulate, and then
hung up in a bag till the whey runs off. In this form it
is both nutritive and wholesome, being more easily
digested than sweet milk; while, to those who take to it,
it is light, palatable and delightfully cooling. Milk is
prepared in this way by the Shetlanders, who in the
first stage call it “run milk,” and when made into skier
“hung milk.” The same preparation is made use of
by the Arabs, and it is also the chief diet of the Kaffirs
and Bechuanas at the Cape. Our idea that milk is
useless or hurtful when soured is merely an ignorant
prejudice. Those who depend for their subsistence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>chiefly on milk diet, and have the largest experience,
prefer to use it sour, and medical authority endorses
their choice. In Icelandic farms hard black rye bread
is at times produced as a luxury; butter is always cured
without salt, and used rancid, however, after it reaches
a certain mild stage it gets no worse; meat is dried at
certain seasons of the year for occasional use, and the
rivers abound in excellent fish. The chief use to which
the kitchen fire is put, is to prepare a cup of warm
coffee. Snaps, sugar candy, coffee, grain, and other
foreign commodities, they obtain at the factories.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scarcity of fuel tempts people to crowd together
for heat; sometimes 15 or 16 people in one small sleeping
apartment, and that often placed over another where
cattle are kept. The state of such an atmosphere may
be imagined, while many dirty habits and the frequent
recourse to stimulants are thus accounted for. Nor will
any one wonder much, although there were no other
causes, that, in one district of the south, 75 per cent of
all the children born die before they complete their
twelfth month.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for indoor occupations, the farmers, as in colonial
outposts, of necessity are Jacks-of-all-trades. They forge
scythes, make saddles and bridles, make their simple
household furniture, horse-shoe nails, and even build or
repair their own houses. Females do the tailoring, but
men make their own shoes and take their turn at the
spinning wheel, the knitting needles, and the loom.
All work together by lamplight, while some one reads
aloud some old-world story. The out-door occupations
are both fishing and farming. The ver-tima, or fishing
season, lasts from February till May, and is chiefly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>carried on, on the south-west coast, which, from thus becoming
a source of wealth, is called Guld-bringu—or the
gold bringing—Sysla. At the beginning of the season,
men move down to the fishing stations. The boats
have each from 4 to 10 oars, and crews of from 10 to 20
men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lines only are used, and the fish caught are chiefly
cod and ling. Part are salted and dried for exportation,
part dried for home use without salt and left at the
stations to be fetched at midsummer, when many
people resort to the annual fair for the sale of produce,
or rather the exchange of commodities. The deep sea
fishing is not prosecuted by the Icelanders, but is
chiefly carried on by the Norwegians, French, and
Dutch. All journeys are performed on horseback.</p>

<p class='c011'>These statements will enable the reader to form an
idea of the ongoings of daily life in the numerous farms,
which are scattered over the habitable belt of pasture-land
which nearly surrounds the island.</p>

<hr class='c023'>

<p class='c011'>Through Zöga, we had an interview with the farmer,
and arranged for the grazing of the ponies on the farm
of Laugervalla. A girl brought out a large basin of
skier, together with a plentiful supply of milk and cream
to us.</p>

<p class='c011'>We looked wistfully to the south-east in the direction
of Hekla which lay about 35 miles distant, but at this
time it was quite hid by an impenetrable veil of clouds
resting on the horizon line. As we were about half-way
from Thingvalla to the Geysers, we mounted the relay
horses, and now it was the turn of those that brought
us thither to be driven before us.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>In Iceland, at whatever pace the ponies run, they are
supposed to be resting, when they carry no load.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our course lay over some wet marshy land—from
which we gathered heather, moss, cotton-grass, and buck-bean—across
a shallow river brawling over white and
slaty coloured stones on its way to the lake; and then
higher up, along the sides of the green hill-range which
trends in the direction of the Geysers. Here dwarf-birches
and willows grew in profusion; while the broken
cakes of black lava, which projected from among them,
served by contrast to add freshness to the greenth of the
foliage, and yet more brilliance to the vari-coloured
flowers which bloomed in beauty on every side. We
saw innumerable coveys of ptarmigan on the hill-sides,
many plovers, snipe, and a few snow-birds. All were
very tame, flitted quite near and seemed to wonder at
our intruding on their amenities. We did not abuse
their confidence, but admiringly allowed them to go, as
they came, in peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coming to a part where the soil was of soft earth and
turf, we found it, for miles, worn by the ponies into very
narrow tracks, averaging two feet in depth. There were
from six to twelve of these tracks, with thin grassy ledges
between them, lying close together nearly parallel and
every little way running into each other; where the
ground sloped, they were dry; and, where it was level or
low, they were full of mud or water. Riding along at a
hard trot, we required to be ever on the alert, and to
maintain an incessant motion of the feet, in order to avoid
collision with the irregular surface and the projecting
stones on either side of us. Tempted by a wild flower
of unusual beauty, I dismounted, but was astonished to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>find that the deep tracks were so narrow that I could
not walk in them, there not being width for my one foot
to pass the other: yet a horse finds no difficulty in
trotting along; actually, however paradoxical it may
seem, requiring less space for its feet than a man.</p>

<p class='c011'>We saw numerous farms as we passed along, each
consisting of a group of irregular hillocks, with the
windows hid deep in the grassy turf like port-holes,
and generally all turned inwards so as to be sheltered
from the roaring blasts of winter. We met ponies
trudging along conveying lambs from one farm to
another. It was curious to see the little animals looking
out of square crate-like boxes, made of spars of wood,
slung in the manner of panniers on a donkey, and
to hear them bleat: reminding one of the old nursery
rhyme “young lambs to sell!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They could not be otherwise transported over lava
tracks and across the rivers which separate one valley
from another. We saw several small caravans or
companies of Icelanders on the way. They had the
same sort of boxes as our baggage ponies, and the same
quaint horse gear, down to the rough hair cords tied and
fastened by passing a sheep’s knee-bone through a loop
to prevent knots from slipping. They had tents and
provisions; one of the ponies carried a leather bottle
probably filled with skier. It was a calf’s skin sewed
up, with the head and legs left on it, so that it presented
a quaint old world look; and recalled pictures in the
catacombs of Egypt. Notwithstanding the difference of
climate, when in contact with the people, one is here,
at every point, reminded of the East and carried back to
patriarchal times. We touched our hats in returning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the salutations of those we met, although we did not
know the exact import of what was said to us on such
occasions till afterwards, when Dr. Mackinlay told me
that an Icelander when he meets a stranger invariably
doffs his bonnet and accosts him with the phrase “Saellar
verith <a id='tn102a'></a>thér!”—“Happy may you be!” or occasionally
with one still more expressive, “Guts fride!”—“God’s
peace be with you!” On saying good-bye, he uncovers
again, and repeats the first phrase with a slight inversion,
“Verith <a id='tn102b'></a>thér saellar!”—“Be ye happy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>After the customary salutations, he accosts everybody
on the road with a series of questions, like a master
hailing a ship. The first question put, is “What is your
name?” the second “Whose son are you?”—for the
general absence of surnames renders this necessary—the
third “Where do you come from?” Then follows
“Whither are you going?” and “What are you going to do
there?” These questions are not regarded as impertinent,
but as exhibiting a kindly interest. Henderson
says, “When you visit a family in Iceland, you must
salute them according to their age and rank, beginning
with the highest and descending according to your best
judgment to the lowest, not even excepting the servants;
but, on taking leave, this order is completely reversed;
the salutation is first tendered to the servants, then to
the children, and last of all to the mistress and master
of the family.” Old friends meeting, salute each other, in
the old Icelandic way, with the kiss of peace. Clergymen
are a privileged body, for, in salutation, even
strangers male or female give them the kiss of peace
and address them as “Sira,” Father. Hence our words
sire and sir. Out of Reykjavik, and away from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>factories, there is much of the oriental type about the
manners and customs of the Icelanders; the same
simplicity, the same native politeness, the same disregard
of cleanliness, and the same dislike of change.</p>

<p class='c011'>We now rode over uneven rocky ground, enriched with
brushwood, till we reached the banks of the Bruará.
This broad, deep, rapid river drains the valley of Laugervalla,
receiving the waters of two lakes, Laugervatn and
Apavatn; which in turn are fed by rivers and streams
from the snow mountains beyond. A few miles south
of us, near Skálholt, it receives the joint waters of the
Túngufljot from Haukadal with the overflow of the
Geysers, the magnificent river Hvitá which flows from a
lake of the same name at the foot of Lang Jökul, and
the Laxá, from Grœnavatn; further down to the south-west
it also receives the Sog flowing from the lake of
Thingvalla; and after draining several hundred miles
of country, these waters, united in a little gulf called
Olfusá, flow into the sea on the west coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Properly speaking, the Bruará terminates when it
joins the longest and principal river of those named—the
Hvitá or White-river—and below the junction, the
whole waters united in one river are simply called the
Hvitá; while the gulph, formed on the coast where it
debouches into the sea, is called Olfusá.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place selected for fording the Bruará is immediately
above a singular waterfall shaped like a horse-shoe—the
concave looks downwards—with a volcanic
fissure or rent from two to three hundred feet long in the
middle of it. This wedge-shaped gap in the bed of the
river runs back to a point, and the water rushes down into
it, from either side, falling into the chasm with a noise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>like thunder. Over this chasm, near the point or part of
it highest up the river, are placed some planks with a
slight hand-rail on either side, forming a rude bridge
about twenty feet long and seven or eight broad. The
river was swollen by recent rains, so that at least a
foot of water lay upon or rather rushed over the bridge
itself. Some thirty feet of the river had to be waded
through ere the bridge in the middle could be reached;
and—guessing its whole width here, say at 70 feet—again
other 20 feet had to be forded after the bridge was
passed, ere the steep rough bank, up which we had to
scramble on the other side, could be attained. The water
was deep, turbulent and rapid; while we could hear large
stones grating on each other as they were borne along
in the current. The eye took in all these bearings at a
glance; there was no pause, Zöga led on and we followed.
Our horses were up to the girths, and seemed walking
over large movable boulders. They leant up the river so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>as to withstand the current. The arrowy swiftness of the
flowing water produced a strange illusory feeling, akin
to giddiness; one could not tell whether the motion
pertained to one’s self, or to the river. A little to our
right was the roaring cataract, so we kept the horses’
heads well up the river, to avoid missing the bridge; in
that case we should inevitably have been swept over.
The view, from the bridge, of the foaming mass of water
through which we moved, and of the yawning gulph into
which it was tumbling and furiously rushing along, far
below our very feet, impressed the situation on our
minds as something unique.</p>

<div id='fig_030'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>CROSSING THE <a id='tn105'></a>BRUARÁ.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>All having got over in safety, we paused for a few
minutes on the top of the high bank to gaze back on the
strange spectacle; while, before us, the river rushing
along into the chasm, although on a smaller scale and
different in kind, suggested Dr. Livingstone’s description
of the great Victoria Falls on the Zambesi. The bridge
has been renewed here from of old. On this account,
the river is named Bruará or Bridge-river; a sufficient
reason, when we mention that there is only one other
bridge in the whole island.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the neighbourhood of the river we saw many small
butterflies—blue and white—both fluttering and flying
kinds; and were much annoyed with mosquitoes like
gnats, that bit our faces severely and would get in
about our necks, persecuting us most pertinaciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Iceland ponies are truly wonderful animals. They
carry one over smooth bare rocks, over great blocks of
lava, up places steeper than a stair but with footing not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>half so good; through mud-puddles, water or bogs;
over tracks of volcanic sand; through coppices; up hill,
down hill; or across rivers. Patient and sure-footed, they
stick at nothing. They are guided by the feet as much as
by the bridle; a gentle touch with the heel being the
Icelandic they are trained to understand. Some riders,
we saw, kept up a constant drumming on the poor beasts’
sides. After their day’s work is done, they receive no
manner of grooming or stabling; saddle and bridle taken
off, they are then left to shift for themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>To our intense satisfaction, Zöga pointed out a hill
about ten miles off, on the other side of which lay the
Geysers. It was detached from the range of hills we
had to skirt, rising with a gentle slope at right angles
to them, and falling abruptly on the other side;
forming a sort of bluff <a id='tn106'></a>headland resting on a marshy
plain. Part of our track lay through a plashy bog; then
we had long level tracks of beautiful velvet turf at the
foot of the hills, which both riders and horses seemed to
think were made expressly for running races upon.
When the ponies could be got into their peculiar amble,
we progressed very pleasantly, and almost as fast as
at a gallop. The hills on our left were mostly green,
covered with dwarf birches, willows and blae-berries.
On their slopes we saw farms, here and there, as we passed
along. The plain immediately on our right, bounded by
distant mountains and jökuls, was marshy. When it
became very spongy and impassible, generally, we had
only to move a little way higher up along the hill side,
in order to obtain firmer footing. Approaching the hill
which separated us from the Geysers, we crossed the
morass, forded a river, rode up a miry lane past a farm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>house, turned the flank of the hill, and beheld clouds of
white steam rising from the slope. The wished for goal
now lay before us. Pushing on rapidly, my trusty little
pony soon reached and picked its way over a gritty
slope, among numerous plopping pits, steaming holes,
boiling springs and fountains, up to the side of the
Great Geyser, where I dismounted at 9 o’clock at night,
having been ten and a half hours in the saddle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Geysers are boiling springs, situated seventy-two
miles north-east of Reykjavik, on a gritty slope, at the
foot of a trap-hill three hundred feet high; and on the
upper border of a green-marshy plain, sloping down
towards a small river which runs meandering through
it in a southern direction. They are about a hundred in
number, and all located in an area of about a quarter of
a mile. Three of them are erupting—the Great Geyser,
Strokr, and the Little Geyser. These, with Blesi, the most
beautiful of the non-erupting springs, and situated a little
way above the great Geyser, are the principal attractions
to a traveller; although all the others, with everything
pertaining to such phenomena, are intensely interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Geyser means gusher or rager; Strokr is derived from
the verb to agitate, and signifies a churn. Instead of an
abstract summary, I shall endeavour as far as possible
to give a detailed account of what we saw, and in the
order of its occurrence. This will enable the reader, as it
were, to accompany us, and gather the distinctive and
varied features of this marvellous scene from the same
points of view.</p>

<p class='c011'>We stand at the side of the great Geyser, on the upper
or north-west corner of a slope; a low trap-hill above us,
the green valley of Haukadal below, and columns, jets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and clouds of white steam rising, curling and waving
from the numerous springs on this upper arid slope on
which we stand. The surface immediately around us—flinty
and paved in thin scaly layers—is of a gritty
reddish irony colour, with streamlets of hot steaming
water trickling along from the overflow of the Geysers,
on their way to join the river below. A long continuous
strip of verdant turf runs up into this slaggy region, between
the great Geyser and Strokr; and elsewhere
various little round green islet-patches about a foot in
diameter occur in it; blooming like oases, and covered
with parnassia, sea-pink, wild-thyme and butter-cups, all
thriving and seeming to enjoy the thermal heat. Here
we found many bits of stick, turf, moss, and flowers, incrusted
over with the silicious deposit of the water and
converted into beautiful petrifactions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great Geyser basin is situated on the top of a
cone shaped mound, which, on account of the uneven
nature of the surrounding ground, seems, from every
different point of view, to vary in height. As we
approached, it appeared seven feet; moving downwards
from the plain, it seemed more than twice as high; while,
from the bottom of a deep gully running immediately
behind and separating it in one direction from the hill,
it seemed to attain an elevation of thirty feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The basin—perfectly smooth, of a whitish colour,
saucer-shaped, slightly oval instead of round, seventy-two
feet at its greatest breadth, seventy feet mean
diameter, and about four feet deep—is full of water to
the brim. In the bottom or centre of this gigantic
saucer, through the clear hot fluid, is seen a round hole
ten feet in diameter. This is the top of a stony funnel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>or pipe which goes down perpendicularly to a depth of
eighty-three feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Geyser-water,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> like many hot springs in India and
other parts of the world, holds in solution a large proportion
of silica or flint. It is well known that this substance,
when fused with potash or soda, under certain circumstances
readily dissolves in boiling water; and, under
various other conditions, it diffuses itself throughout the
arcana of nature; finding its way to varnish the stalk of
corn in our fields, or the bamboo in Indian jungles, both
preserving them from damp and adding strength to their
extreme lightness. Fused masses of silica have at times
been found among the ashes of a haycock which has been
accidentally burned; and the same substance, arrested
and deposited in crystalline lumps, is at times met with,
though rarely, in joints of cane, and when so found is by
the natives called Tabasheer.</p>

<p class='c011'>This flint-depositing property, resident in the water,
has enabled the Geyser to raise its own pipe, basin and
mound. The original basin or orifice, when the spring
began, must have been at the bottom of the tube; the
overflow, spreading, would then continue to go on and
form thin laminated cakes of silicious deposit around it;
eruptions would keep the hole open and smooth at the
edge, ever adding layer to layer till it became a tube.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Thus through the lapse of time—probably about a
thousand years—tube, basin and cone have, without
doubt, been built up to their present elevation; and will
continue to rise till the weight of the super-encumbent
column of water becomes so great as to exceed the eruptive
forces, or these latter from any other cause cease to
operate, when the Geyser will probably remain tranquil
for a time, and then slowly continue to deposit flint on
the surface edges, till at length they meet and finally
altogether seal up the cone.</p>

<p class='c011'>This supposition is not altogether hypothetical, but is
deduced from our having observed, both here and elsewhere,
mounds, plainly of Geyserine formation, thus
covered over, extinct and silent; little rocky elevations
left like warts on the surface of the ground; and even
the tracks or dry-beds of the meandering rivulets, which
once carried away their overflow, still left, distinctly
traceable, down the sintery slope.</p>

<p class='c011'>Strokr is situated about four-hundred feet south from
the great Geyser. It has not a regularly formed basin
like the other, but is surrounded to a considerable
distance by a slight elevation, of light flinty grit and
laminae, with sundry depressions in it; all being deposited
after the manner already described. In the centre,
through brown coloured sinter, is a deep hole, like a well,
six feet in diameter at the surface, contracting as it descends
and attaining a depth of nearly fifty feet. On looking
down, the water is seen, ten or twelve feet from the
surface—boiling hard, plop-plopping, roaring, choking,
and rumbling continually; in fact, as its name indicates,
agitated and seething like a churn. The edge, however,
must be approached with great caution, as eruptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>occur without any warning; when jets of boiling water
shoot up to the height of sixty feet, or, when choked
with turf to provoke an eruption, to the height of 150
feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Little Geyser, situated upwards of 300 feet south
of Strokr, presents a similar appearance, only it is on
a smaller scale; the tube is less than forty feet deep.
The eruptions, occurring every half-hour or so, were like
playing fountains; but they only attained a height of 10
to 15 feet, and lasted about five minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief non-erupting spring, Blesi—so called from
its fancied resemblance to white marks on a horse’s
face—is situated say about 250 feet to the west of the
Great Geyser, and a little higher up the hill. It is a
large irregular oval opening into a cavern full of clear hot
water, up to the same level as the ground. It is about
40 or 50 feet long, 10 to 20 broad, and spanned across
the centre, so as apparently to form two separate oval
pools, by a natural rock bridge. The top of this bridge
is only about a foot broad, and raised an inch or so above
the surface of the water, while the arch is quite under
it. One can thus see through the clear water from the
one pool to the other, the same as if this curious
division were not there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Standing with our backs to the hill, we observed that
the south edge of the spring was only a shelving ledge
of silicious sinter, covering in or roofing the water; and
that, 3 or 4 feet further in, the side of the cavern,
dipping abruptly and continuing to cave into fathomless
darkness, with its whitish crags, precipices, and projecting
ledges, could be distinctly followed for 40 or 50 feet
far down through the clear pure scalding water which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>was perfectly still. It never boils; but its gentle overflow
winds southward along the slope, steaming all the way.
The blue tint of the transparent water near the side was
exquisitely delicate, and appeared to be caused by light,
modified and reflected somehow from the craggy sides,
although they were whitish in colour, while the
crystalline water near the sides was actually as bright
as lapis-lazuli, shading magically into the most tender
sea-green. Gazing down on the subaqueous jags, the
yawning fissure, spite of its stillness and heat, suggested
Schiller’s poem of the Diver, and then again Hans
Christian Andersen’s brilliant word picture of the Blue
grotto of Capri; combining, as it does, elements both of
terror and beauty. We were strangely fascinated by this
spring, which although now so tranquil only ceased to be
an active erupting Geyser in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1784, the year after the
terrific eruption of <a id='tn112'></a>Skaptár, when earthquakes disturbed
and wrought sundry changes on the Geyser ground, and,
according to Henderson, opened up thirty-five new
springs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rest of the springs are situated chiefly on the
lower or south-west corner of the slope, and also at
the foot of the hill, in the deep gully at the back of the
great Geyser. They are of various kinds and close
together; little pools of hot water level with the surface;
others, boiling hard, below it; dark holes with steam
rising from them; others where, though no water could
be seen, it was heard seething below, and felt to be
boiling by the vibratory motion it communicated to the
ground on which we stood; others seemed caldrons of
seething clay; while, in many places around, when a
stick was thrust 12 or 18 inches into the ground and
withdrawn, steam issued from the hole so made.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Nearly all these springs have an alkaline reaction,
and give out more or less sulphurated hydrogen. My
thermometer, dipt in at the edge of the great Geyser
when at rest but full to the brim, indicated 178°, and
the temperature was pretty equal all round its basin.
Blesi was hotter, and on repeated trials stood at 196°.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Zöga was busy pitching the tent, lent us by
the Count Von Trampe, on the narrow turf plat, about
30 or 40 yards south-west of the great Geyser, we
observed, besides the white vapour which always hovers
over it, bubbles rising from the surface of the water
over the hole in the centre of the saucer-shaped basin;
then the water became troubled; a stream of hissing
steam rushed up with a noise resembling the whiz of a
rocket; we heard subterranean sounds like the rumbling
of distant thunder, broken in upon at intervals by the
booming of artillery; a dome of water, like a gigantic
glass shade eight or ten feet high, then rose and burst
with a loud explosion, as if a submarine blast had just
been fired. We expected a grand eruption, but this
time were disappointed; for only one other bell, smaller
than the first, rose and fell, enveloped in dense clouds of
steam slightly impregnated with sulphur; the troubling
of the water speedily subsided, low muffled sounds died
away, losing themselves in distant mutterings, and the
Geyser pot boiled over; but very quietly, as there was
no fire outside to be put out by the little rills of scalding
water. These ran trickling down the sides all round,
but chiefly on the south-west where there are several
slight indentations in the lip of the basin, and where at
the foot of the mound the bed of a shallow streamlet has
been formed which winds through the gritty slope,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>conveying the Geyser’s overflow, steaming as it runs,
down to the river. This little rivulet spreads out broad
and shallow, as it flows over the gritty surface, being
only, excepting after eruptions, one or two inches deep,
with many little islet-patches of verdure in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>These islets are sometimes formed by a single tuft of
butter-cups, sea-pinks, wild-thyme, or parnassia; quietly
blooming in freshness and beauty in this strange habitat,
cared for and cherished by the same beneficent hand
that controls the under-lying and central fires, with all
their marvellous and terrific phenomena.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our attention was now called to the Little Geyser,
which exhibited great activity, shooting up several jets
of water at the same time like a fountain, while great
volumes of steam rolled away from it to the leeward.
Its eruptions did not attain, as already stated, more than
a height of from ten to fifteen feet, and lasted only for
about five minutes; but they occurred every little while
during our stay.</p>

<p class='c011'>We sketched this singular region from various points
of view; wonder ever increasing, as we wandered about
and discovered one marvel after another. For, be it
confessed, that on approaching the Geysers, utterly
fagged and weary, I felt all curiosity so blunted, that,
for the first fifteen minutes, I believe I would scarcely
have risen from the turf on which I sat to walk a mile,
though it had been to see the earth split open to its
very centre; and, for the moment, serious thoughts of
how I was ever to undergo the ride back occupied my
mind. Such however are the recuperative powers of
nature, that, after a rest of twenty minutes, I again felt
equal to anything, and wandered about seeing what was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>to be seen till 11 o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, when Zöga announced
that dinner was ready.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tea was made with hot water from the great Geyser,
because it afforded the nearest supply; but our provisions
were cooked in Blesi, because it was of a higher
temperature. The water had no unpleasant taste and
was quite fit for our temporary use.</p>

<p class='c011'>Zöga’s mode of cooking was simple, a fine large trout,
with head and tail tied together, was fastened to one end
of a string, and a big stone to the other; the fish was
plumped into the water and the stone left outside near
the edge to moor it; so with tins of preserved meats,
soups, &#38;c. They required to be immersed for about
twenty minutes. With these, a plentiful supply of bread,
biscuit and cheese, and the addition of a pailful of milk
from the farm, we fared sumptuously; dining al-fresco,
in broad <a id='tn115'></a>daylight and the thermometer indicating 58°,
although it was near midnight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several loud reports, rumblings, noises, and minor
troublings of the water, again brought us to the side of
the great Geyser, in expectation of a grand eruption, but
these came to nothing, and again we were disappointed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tent was small; three of our companions crept in
and lay down, leaving a place for me to follow. Professor
Chadbourne, fearing he might miss an eruption, would
not leave the ground, although he had been offered
quarters at the farm; but, selecting a warm ledge of rock
immediately under the Geyser, on the north side, lay
down to sleep, wrapt up in my storm-coat.</p>

<p class='c011'>All had now retired but Mr. Murray who accompanied
me to the hill behind, from which we obtained a bird’s-eye
view of the plain, with the river meandering through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>it, and of the numerous springs in the corner immediately
below us.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun in the north did little more than dip and
skim along a little way below the horizon; so that
between twelve and one o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> it was lighter than
on a southern cloudy day at noon; while the whole
atmosphere, in the light “dim,” exhibited a northern
depth, transparency, and calm spiritual purity, surpassing
the loveliest of our summer twilights. Those who
love Dante will perhaps realize the impression it
produced on our minds, when we say, that, although it
was too light for any stars to be visible, the ethereal
beauty of the sky suggested Beatrice. Returning to the
tent before one o’clock, Mr. Murray ensconced himself
comfortably outside, in the lee of it; and I crept in,
spread my plaid and lay down without disturbing any
one, although the four of us inside were packed together
as closely as sardines.</p>

<p class='c011'>After Mr. Murray had bade me good night through
the canvas, hearing the harsh croak of the raven, and
the eerie whistle of the plover, I, too, quickly fell asleep,
and dreamt a queer disjointed jumble of Scandinavian
myths new and old, of which I only remembered, Odin’s
Raven flapping its wings and leading me to Rabna
Floki; seeing that worthy thrash Thor, after having
eaten his hammer; and Loki kindling Midgard with fire
from the Serpent’s eyes; the winds, all the while, sighing
a requiem for Baldur, through <a id='tn116'></a>Yggdrasill the ash tree of
existence. The rocks were being hurled about by the
Jötuns, who in the midst of their conflict opened a space
and respectfully stood aside, to allow Professor Chadbourne
to approach me. Hearing myself called upon by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>name, I suddenly woke up, and saw my friend, in front
of the tent, beckoning to me in a state of great
excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Subterranean noises like thunder were waxing louder
and louder; each earth-shock accompanied by a tremor of
the ground, more or less violent, but quite unmistakeable.
Bells of water in quick succession were rising from the
basin and falling again, ever increasing in size, till a
large one burst; and then jets of water, in successive
spurts, rushed up in sheafs from the tube; at first
about 10 feet, then the height was 15, 20, 30, 50 feet
and so on, each effort surpassing the preceding, till it
attained the height of 200 feet. The fountain did not
fall down between each jet, but, nearly holding the
elevation once gained, the whole grew up bodily by a
series of jerks each higher than the last. Dense clouds
of steam enveloped the whole, and only afforded occasional
glimpses of the columns of water from the leeward
side. White vapour also spread out above the
fountain, rolling away in vast curling volumes, which,
condensing in the air, came down like heavy dew.
Tremendous sounds were continuously heard, like the
roaring of an angry sea, broken in upon by the near
discharge of minute guns. It is at last, what we longed
to behold, a grand eruption of the great Geyser.</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Chadbourne, who came running to the tent
to rouse me, had been sleeping for warmth on a ledge
immediately under the basin; and, when wakened by the
loud noises, two streams of boiling water were running
down the mound in <a id='tn117'></a>miniature cascades on either side of
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The vast body of water from the central pipe continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>jetting up, till, as I have said, it attained the height
of 200 feet, falling down again into the basin which
was brimful to overflowing. The subterranean rumbling
sounds and reports, accompanied with vibration of
the ground, were fearful. Jets of water rushed up, in
sheaf, with a continuous noise, such as would be produced
by 500 rockets discharged into the air at the
same instant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even the beautiful clouds of steam which robed the
Geyser were regarded by us with an indescribable
feeling of mysterious awe and wonder, as if we had
actually discovered the fabled magic vapour, from which
the eastern Ufret, or any other vision, might arise; while
the sharp tinkling plash of the descending water could,
at times, be heard amidst the loud hissing, roaring,
booming and confused Babel of all unearthly sounds.
The eruptive forces having now expended themselves
for the time, the fountain gradually subsided in the same
manner, though more speedily than it had risen. The
whole terrific spectacle lasted about twenty minutes.
We were singularly fortunate, as, from what we were told,
few eruptions of late have lasted more than four or five
minutes, or attained half the height of this which we
had just witnessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>When over, the water subsided and left the basin
empty, so that one could walk in it to the edge of the
central tube-hole, and look down. As the water thus
sank, so great was the heat in the stone that the cup was
instantaneously, though bit by bit, left as dry as an oven.
Smooth and of a whitish colour, it resembled the chalice
of a gigantic water-lily. At the edges however, where
silex has been deposited from the spray and condensed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>steam, the surface, although of the same colour, is rough
like coral, or rather granulated like the head of a
cauliflower. I broke off specimens of this singular
formation from the lip, and also obtained bits of shingly
laminæ from the mound, the latter not unlike the outside
of an oyster-shell; on several of the fragments was a
deposit of sulphur.</p>

<p class='c011'>I now retired to the tent, but the Professor made to
sleep, sitting on the edge with his feet in the dry basin,
determined to miss nothing. In an hour or so he was
warned back by the water gradually rising and again
filling the cup. There was not much hazard in his so
doing, as the premonitory symptoms are generally “loud
enough,” as my friend Dr. Mackinlay quaintly remarked,
“to disturb the repose of Rip Van Winkle himself.”
However, danger may arise from these symptoms being
disregarded, as they also precede abortive attempts, in a
very deceptive and tantalizing way; getting louder and
louder up to a certain point, and then, instead of coming
to a head, gradually subsiding again into perfect stillness.
The deafening detonations and rumblings are
most frequent fast and furious, immediately before, and
during eruptions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Geyser made another grand display, early in the
morning between four and five o’clock; but it fell far
short of the first in magnitude. Tired with the fatigues
of the preceding days, with broken rest and excitement,
I only mechanically sat up, thrust aside the canvas of the
tent and gazed out on the strange scene, scarcely able
to keep my eyes half open the while. My recollections
of it are consequently somewhat vague and nebulous;
having reference to loud discordant noises muffled up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>white clouds, both strangely rising from the earth. In
fact, to me scarcely half awake and perfectly passive, all
seemed an evanescent dream, and I speedily sank back
again to enjoy “the honey heavy dew of slumber;” for
to the way-worn and weary, nature’s soft nurse proffers
that which is best for them, viz., repose; and as the
laureate sings,</p>

<p class='c021'><i>July 31.</i>—Had the luxury of a hot bath at the great
Geyser; dipping a rough towel into its basin, and tempering
down the heat in one of the cooler little pools
formed on its ledge by the overflow. When bathing my
feet and half dressed, the Geyser exhibited premonitory
symptoms of an eruption, the water bubbling violently
over the pipe, streams of hissing steam, noises like
thunder, then like artillery, a tremor of the ground,
then a transparent dome of water heaved up about four
feet and burst. Gathering up my clothes, bare-footed, I
scampered off as fast as possible; fortunately without
cutting myself on the flinty scale-like laminæ, which on
the edges are as hard and sharp as knives. It was only
a little disturbance which subsided in a few minutes,
but shallow streams of boiling water flowed down over
the very part of the basin where I had been standing.
Afterwards returning with Professor Chadbourne, we
completed our toilet, giving a keen edge to our razors by
dipping them into the hot water of the great Geyser, at
the same time making use of a little pool at the side as
a mirror. The matter-of-fact oddness of the situation recalled
sundry adventures of Don Quixote, when in quest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of another basin—that of the barber, which he mistook
for the enchanted golden helmet of Mambrino. The
Geyser also did efficient duty as pot and tea-kettle for
breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>About ten o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> we witnessed an eruption of
Strokr. All of a sudden, we heard as it were the whiz of
a rocket, and saw a jet of water spouting up in a single
column, to the height of fifty or sixty feet, straight as
the trunk of a palm tree, but spreading out at the top,
bending gracefully down all round, and falling in clouds
of spray. It lasted for about ten minutes, subsided, and
began again. Some of us, looking down, narrowly
escaped being scalded by its sudden vehement and unexpected
spurts. The ascending water shewed beautifully
clear and transparent against the sky; and gleaming
rainbows came and went—now bright as the tint of
flowers, now dim and evanescent—lending opaline lustres
to the falling showers of diamond spray.</p>

<p class='c011'>After all was over, Zöga collected several heaps of turf
at the side, and then at once plumped them all in, to
provoke an eruption. We expected the dose would take
effect in twenty minutes or half-an-hour; but a whole
hour having elapsed without any sign, we began to fear
it would exhibit no resentment at being made to eat
dirt. Five minutes more, however, and up it came,
rushing with tremendous force, in several jets, and
attaining a height of from a hundred to a hundred and
fifty feet. The water falling back, nearly in a perpendicular
line, was met by up-rushing steam, and thus
formed a glassy dome, from which jets of water sprang
up. This disturbance lasted twenty-one minutes; was
followed by a lull; then it commenced again, subsided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and ended by one or two explosions and spurts, after
which the water sunk down into the pipe, rumbling,
seething, boiling hard, and plop-plopping as before. The
water this time was black and dirty with the particles of
sand and turf which had been administered to it; so
that, although higher, it lacked the fairy-like beauty of
the last eruption. I had thrown in a white cambric
pocket handkerchief with some turf tied in it; but,
instead of its being washed and thrown up, suppose it
must have been cooked, and reduced to “shreds and
patches” or pulp, as I saw no more of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several cows were wandering near the Geysers quite
unconcerned. Many sheep and lambs browse in the
valley beneath, occasionally approaching the springs.
Accidents, however, seldom occur; although we were
told of an unlucky ox having once stumbled into Blesi,
where it was boiled alive. Sea-swallows were flying
overhead; and at our feet, among the stony grit, grew
isolated patches of wild-thyme, sea-pinks, dandelions,
butter-cups, sorrel and parnassia—all of them old friends,
and quite home-like. The thermometer stood at 60° in
the shade. At noon, being Sabbath, we sat down in the
lee of the tent, which was fluttering in the breeze, and
Mr. Haycock read the service for the day—Professor
Chadbourne and I taking the lessons; gave an English
Testament, and some of the Religious Tract Society’s
illustrated publications to Zöga, who could both read
and translate them to his brother guides.</p>

<p class='c011'>After dinner walked down to the river. On either
side of its course lies a strip of meadow, where the
herbage is rich, green, tender and luxuriant like a velvet
carpet; the valley around, though also green, is in many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>places wet and spongy; covered with heather and moss-hags.</p>

<p class='c011'>The overflow of the Geysers comes down, steaming, to
the river, through the brown shingle which is variegated
here and there with little strips and patches of verdure.
After great eruptions there is some body of water; at
other times it merely trickles, spread over a wide bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wandering about, I visited every one of the springs
alone. In the south corner of the Geyser ground, steaming
pits occur every little bit: the crust there is very
thin, so that one requires to tread with caution. Some
of them are merely holes in this thin crust, showing
steaming pools of hot water, flush with the surface and
extending under it; others are holes in rocks, deep, dark
and craggy, with the water far down boiling furiously
and seething in white foam; such is Strokr. Some are
as if one looked down the kitchen chimney of a castle in
the olden time when good cheer was preparing: you
hear boiling going on but see nothing, for all is dark.
Others throw up jets of steam. At many places you
hear internal cauldrons boiling violently, at others you
can also see puffs of steam escaping at intervals from
small clay holes. The Little Geyser enlivens the scene
by throwing up many jets of steaming water, at different
angles, playing like a fountain several times in the
course of an hour or so; nor does the great Geyser
allow itself to be long forgotten: loud noises, rising bells
of water, and other premonitory symptoms frequently
calling us up to its side in expectation of grand eruptions;
for, more perfect in its formation and larger than
any of the other springs, it is justly regarded as the chief
attraction of the place.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Sir George Mackenzie attempted to explain the
mechanism of the Geyser eruptions, by supposing that
the tube was fed from hot water confined in a neighbouring
subterranean cavern. This water was forced into
and up the tube by the pressure of steam, accumulated
between the surface of the water and the roof of the
hypothetical cavern, when it had attained power sufficient
to overcome the resistance of the column of water contained
in the tube.</p>

<p class='c011'>For several reasons, this explanation is unsatisfactory;
and the more likely theory is the chemical one, propounded
by Bunsen who spent eleven days here. In
few words it is as follows. The water in the lower part
of the tube gets heated far above the boiling point by the
surrounding strata; water, thus super-heated for a length
of time, is known to undergo certain changes which
materially modify its composition; particles of air are
expelled, the component molecules consequently adhere
more closely together, so that it requires a much higher
temperature to make it boil. When, however, under
these conditions, it does boil, the production of steam is
so great and instantaneous as sufficiently to account for
all the phenomena of a Geyser eruption.</p>

<p class='c011'>This theory is supported by various facts. The
temperature, both in the Geyser tube and in Strokr,
gradually rises towards the bottom, and increases before
eruptions. It has actually been found as high as 261°
Fahrenheit, which is 39° above the boiling point. In
ordinary circumstances it would be found equal throughout,
or, if a difference were appreciable, the hottest
water, being the lightest, would rise to the top. Stones
have been suspended at the bottom and remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>undisturbed by eruptions, showing that the super-heating
process went on above them in the tube itself; and
lastly, M. Donny, of Ghent, has produced precisely the
same effects in miniature; using for the experiment a
brass tube stopped with a cork, and heating it all round
with charcoal fires; one, if we remember rightly, at the
bottom of the pipe, and another half-way up.</p>

<p class='c011'>This theory would also explain the terrific and
destructive water eruptions of Kötlugjá, provided the
water actually does come from the crater, as is said, and
not rather from the great deposits of surface snow and
ice melted by the internal heat of the mountain. One of
these eruptions in 1755—the year of the earthquake at
Lisbon—destroyed 50 farms in the low country, with
many men and cattle. Of the two Geyser-theories,
Bunsen’s is the more likely to prove the correct one.</p>

<p class='c011'>After exploring the plain and gazing on the farm of
Haukadal, which is situated on a height about three
quarters of a mile to the north of the Geyser and
celebrated as the birth-place of Ari Frodi the earliest
historian of the north and the first compiler of the <a id='tn125'></a>Landnámabok,
accompanied by Mr. Murray, I ascended the
hill behind so as to get a complete bird’s-eye view of the
Geyser ground, and the whole valley of Haukadal or
Hawk-dale. The view of this singular region from
thence, is peculiar, and I shall try to convey an idea of
it, even at the risk of repetition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Below, a green marshy plain runs nearly north and
south; the river, winding through it, shows here and
there little serpentine reaches of water like bits of
mirror; the horizon, on the south and south-east, is
bounded by a low sloping range of purple hills, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>several low detached heights shaped like the Nineveh
mounds. On the north and north-east rise several
distant mountains. One of them is a Jökul, with
perpetual snow and ice on its summit, and ribbed with
white streaks down its sides. On the west is the hill-range
on which we now stand. It is considerably
higher, rougher, and wilder in character than the heights
on the other side of the valley. Near the foot of the
hills, at our feet, are bluff banks covered with reddish
irony mould, not unlike old red sandstone; these
deposits however we afterwards found to be fine clay,
containing iron oxidized by exposure to the air, and
very slippery to walk upon. From these red banks
there stretches a gentle slope, mostly covered with a
brown and white silicious stuff like slag, such as is seen
on many garden walks. On this little slope are the
Geysers; and all the springs occur within the small
space of about fifty acres.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great Geyser is the most northern, and lies on
our extreme left. From where we stand, it resembles
an artificial mill pond with an embankment rising all
round it and slanting—to compare great things with
small—like the sides of a limpet-shell from which the
top or cone has been struck off. Clouds of white
vapour hovered over it, as it lay gleaming like a silver
shield. Near it, is our tent, and a heap of boxes,
saddles, and other gear lying piled on the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little higher up and nearer us, on the right, lies the
tranquil and beautiful spring of Blesi. More to the
right, but lower down, that dark hole like a well is
Strokr. Yet further, in the same direction, the little
Geyser is in full play, sending up numerous jets of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>water like a fountain; while volumes of steam are
rising from it, and rolling away to the south. To the
right of the little Geyser, and on the slope which runs
down eastward below it, are numerous little round pools,
close together, which reflect the sky, and look as if
they were blue eyes gazing from earth to heaven. Little
jets and puffs of white vapour rise from among them.
Several farms are in sight; cattle are grazing on the
plain; tern and snipe are flying athwart the sky; wind-clouds
are gathering in the north; but the hazy veil in
the south-east, which conceals Hekla and other mountains
in that direction, has not been lifted. Instead of
being sated with the scene before us, wonder increases
every time we survey it, or dwell on the striking features
of its marvellous phenomena.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now between ten and eleven o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> We
descended leisurely to the brink of the Geyser, were
joined by several of our party, and there sang several fine
old psalm-tunes, such as “York” and the “Old Hundred,”
in full harmony.</p>

<p class='c011'>These, associated as they ever are in our minds with
the language of Scripture, lost none of their impressive
grandeur, thus heard by waters that are not always still,
in the land of destroying mountains, burnt mountains,
earthquakes, and storms. Where we have Geysers—gushers
or pourers forth—as in the valley of Siddim;
indeed, there is a valley with the very same name, rendered
in Icelandic instead of Hebrew, viz. Geysadal, a little to
the north-west of Krabla. Places with parched ground,
waste and desolate; a wilderness wherein there is no
man. A land where red-hot pumice or ashes, fire and
brimstone, shot up into the air by volcanoes, have oft-times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>been rained from heaven; and, on every side the once
molten lava flood—which is graphically described by Job
as overtaking and arresting mortals, carrying their
substance away and devouring their riches by fire—may
be observed crossing the ancient track.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where, excepting for a few months in the year, hoar-frost
is scattered like ashes, and the treasures of the snow
or of the hail are not hid; and the face of the deep itself
is often frozen. Again, He causeth His wind to blow
and the waters flow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where spring comes with the small rain on the tender
herb; valleys are watered by springs; grass grows for
the cattle, and the pastures are clothed with flocks.
Where we encounter nomades pitching their tents, and
many old eastern customs that remind us of the dwellers
in Mesopotamia. Where we behold the eagle mounting
on high and spreading abroad her wings, and hear the
young ravens which cry. The swan too, and other
migratory birds may be seen stretching their wings
towards the south. Around its shores leviathans
play in the deep; and there too go the ships.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here in an especial manner we are reminded, at every
step, of the wondrous works of Him who looketh on the
earth and it trembleth; He toucheth the hills and they
smoke: the mountains quake at Him and the hills melt,
and the earth is burnt at His presence. His fury is
poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down
by Him. The earth shook and trembled, the foundations
of the hills moved and were shaken. Truly
wonderful are His works, who maketh His angels spirits,
His ministers a flaming fire!</p>

<p class='c011'>Such were some of our thoughts as we stood, at midnight,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>singing these grand old psalm tunes, by the side
of the Geyser; reminded, in a peculiar manner, that
the whole surface of the globe is after all but a thin
crust, cooled down and caked over the great molten
central mass of liquid fire which constitutes our planet;
and how easily, were latent forces called forth, or even
were those powers which are already developed only
roused into more energetic action, the whole might
explode<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> like a shell filled with molten iron—the myriad
scattered fragments then “spinning down the ringing
grooves of change” as a shower of <a id='tn129'></a>asteroids—nor could
the orphaned moon survive the dire catastrophe!</p>

<p><span class='small'>THE GREAT GEYSER.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Although midnight is spoken of, it was quite light, and
I sketched for nearly an hour and a half, beginning at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>quarter-past 12 o’clock. Before Professor Chadbourne
left for the night-quarters which Zöga had secured for
him at the neighbouring farm, we two stood together on
the brink of the Great Geyser, filled our glasses with its
hot water—pure, and, as soon as it cooled down below
the scalding point, drank to absent friends on both sides
of the Atlantic; this toast having special reference to
our own distant homes. Then four separate Geyser-bumpers
were devoted respectively to Longfellow,
William and Mary Howitt, Dr. Laurence Edmondston
of Shetland, and Gísli Brynjúlfsson the Icelandic poet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Properly speaking there was no night at all; only a
slight dim towards two o’clock in the morning, which I
took as a hint to get quietly under the canvas of our
tent. The wind rose, increasing to a gale; our tent-lining
came down and the sides flapped up, fluttering
in the wind with a noise like platoon firing. For me,
sleep was impossible; but as I was very tired and
things could not well be much worse, I patiently lay
still till five o’clock in the morning, when we all rose,
and Zöga struck the tent. The wind blowing from the
north-coast, on which many icebergs were at present
stranded, was piercingly cold, and reminded us of the
Duke’s allusion, in the forest of Arden, to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“The icy fang</div>
      <div class='line'>And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which when it bites and blows upon my body</div>
      <div class='line'>Even till I shrink with cold, I smite and say,</div>
      <div class='line'>This is no flattery.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>As breakfast would not be ready for a couple of hours,
I took some brandy and hot water at the Geyser, literally
to stop my teeth from chattering, and descended into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>gully behind to examine the banks of coloured clay.
These lie, just under the Geyser, on the north-west side.
Steam may be observed escaping from many little clay
holes, and the sound of boiling may be heard inside at
places where there are no holes. This hot clay is deposited
in horizontal layers, red, purple, violet, white, light blue,
and pale green. These colours occur by themselves,
and are also occasionally found mixed together, mottled
and variegated like a cake of fancy soap or a sheet of
marble paper. Judging by the taste, the clay seems
impregnated with sulphuric acid; and, to the touch, it is
of a very fine consistency, having no grit whatever. I
secured specimens of the finest colours, cutting them like
butter with a table knife, and filled several empty preserved-meat
cans to take home for analysis. The colours
are most beautiful, but, apparently caused by oxydized
iron, would, I fear, be useless as pigments. If this fine
clay could be put to any use in the potteries, thousands
of tons might be obtained here and also at Krisuvik.</p>

<p class='c011'>What leads me to suppose that the colouring matter
of the alumina chiefly consists of iron, is the fact that,
excepting where the layers were evidently freshly laid
bare to view by water or by some other mechanical
means, the banks, however beautifully variegated beneath,
invariably exhibited no colour but red on the surface;
or, in other words, the iron was uniformly oxydized
by exposure to the air.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Further down the gully, we came upon large rough
slabs of whitish stone, beautifully variegated with tints
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>of violet, red, and yellow, dashed with blue. These were
in compact laminae, and each colour about the fourth of
an inch in thickness. In several instances however the
colours, as in the clays, were mixed. I broke up several
masses, and secured a number of the most characteristic
and beautiful specimens. We also obtained chalcedony
and agate, at times approaching to opal; these and cornelian
being only varieties of silex, colour making the
chief difference.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before filling some bottles with Geyser water, as the
wind was fresh, I set one of them afloat to be carried
across the basin before it. When the half of its venturous
voyage was accomplished and it had reached the
tube in the centre, a little eruption came on, by which
the bottle was thrown up, and floated over the outer edge
of the basin. I succeeded in getting hold of it uninjured,
arrested in a little pool amid the boiling water which
was flowing down the sides, and afterwards filled it,
marking it specially for Dr. R. Angus Smith;—“one
whose name,” in a different sense however from that in
which Keats used the expression, “is writ in water,”
and let me add, in <i>air</i> too; for, in connection with
sanatory matters and the supply or purification of these
two health-giving elements to towns, no man in Europe
has analyzed more water; nor was there any known
index of local atmospheric insalubrity but the mortality
bills, till he made his great discovery—the Air-test. On
all such subjects there is no higher scientific authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wandering, once more to bid farewell to the other
springs, we could not but remark that the whole slope is
a thin crust, with innumerable caldrons below; these each
preserve their individuality, although the central heat be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>common to all, for the various eruptions seem to be
quite independent of each other. Blesi was quite tranquil
during the eruption of its neighbour the great
Geyser; and the other springs take as little notice of the
Little Geyser’s activity as it does of Strokr. Wonder
ever increases, although the ground has been gone over
so often as to be already quite familiar to us.</p>

<p class='c011'>Breakfast waits and is soon despatched with keen
relish. Packing done, horses ready, and a guide left to
find three that have strayed, we start on our return
journey to Thingvalla and Reykjavik at a quarter to
eight <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> Truly, as Shakspere hath it,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“Nature oftentimes breaks forth</div>
      <div class='line'>In strange eruptions!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The wind was still from the north and bitterly chill.
On rounding the shoulder of the hill, we picked up the
Professor, at the farm house. The room he slept in had
been all carefully washed out on purpose to receive him,
the earthen floor as well, so that it was very damp. He
was assisted to undress by the hostess, till he called a
halt, and insisted on retaining some portion of his under-clothing.
Then, after he lay down, a basin of milk was
brought and placed at his bed-side. Had he looked
under the pillow, he would probably have discovered a
bottle of brandy deposited there for his own especial use;
but, as the worthy Professor would have left it precisely
as he found it, no “sense of loss” dawned upon him
when the probability was hinted at.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rector Jonson subsequently explained to me the
rationale of the hostess, or her daughter, attending to
guests. Among the Icelanders, wet feet and thorough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>drenchings are incident to locomotion. It is the universally
acknowledged duty of the female department to
render the way-worn traveller such assistance as he may
require, taking away his wet stockings and mud-soaked
garments at night, and returning them to him, dry and
comfortable, in the morning. This simple old custom,
which is also to be met with in various parts of Norway
and Sweden, will give the key to many funny exaggerations
on the subject, where the art of putting things has
been employed chiefly in the direction of the ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c011'>We see on the way many lovely wild flowers, which
confirm our previous observation that they are larger in
the petals, but smaller in the leaves and stems than the
same kinds at home; the aroma is also less. This is
caused by their receiving more light and less heat, in the
short Icelandic summer, than in more southern climes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Graceful white sea-swallows are darting about; curlews
are very tame, flying within a few yards of us or
sitting unconcerned on stones till we ride past them,
noting their beautifully speckled breasts, long bent bills,
and plaintive tremulous whistle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The atmosphere was now much clearer, and many
distant snow-covered mountains were visible on our left.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Zöga pointed out one of a peculiar shape, which he informed
us was <a id='tn135'></a>Skaptár Jökul, the most destructive volcano
in the island. Of this, however, again.</p>

<p class='c011'>A bird, with a red breast, perched on a block of lava
near us; this, the Professor told me, was the American
robin. It seemed as large as our blackbird.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>MOUNT HEKLA.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Retracing our steps, we crossed the Bruará, ascended
the heights, and at length got into the green level plain,
halting at the same spot where we had rested in coming
along. Here we obtained a magnificent view of Hekla,
and made a number of sketches. The prospect varies
but little, as we ride along skirting the hills and at
length ascend them on the other side of the plain. From
this point, Hekla still appears dome-shaped; the three
peaks being scarcely perceptible from the distance—about
thirty miles—at which we stand, and only indicated
by very slight dints in its rounded outline. The
mountain, covered with snow and mottled here and there
with black patches, rises beyond a low range of purple
hills and towers high above them, in shape and colour
not unlike Mont Blanc as seen from the banks of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Arve below Geneva, if we could only imagine the monarch
of mountains deprived of his surrounding Aiguilles,
and left standing alone over the vale of Chamouni.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bird’s-eye view of the great flat green plain, with
rivers meandering through it, which stretches from the
low range of purple hills over which Hekla rises to the
foot of the heights on which we now ride, is both striking
and picturesque.</p>

<p class='c011'>About twenty volcanoes have been in action in
Iceland for the last 1000 years. Of these the eruptions
of Hekla have been the most frequent, although by no
means so destructive as many of the others. Only
attaining a height of about 5000 feet, it owes its
celebrity to the frequency of its eruptions; to its rising
from a plain, being visible from a frequented part
of the island, and quite accessible; and also to the fact
of its being well seen, from the sea, by vessels sailing to
Greenland and North America. Four and twenty
eruptions, of lava, sand or pumice, are recorded; the last
having occurred in 1846. The intervals between these
eruptions vary from six to seventy-six years, the average
period being thirty-five; but some of them have lasted
as long as six years at a time.</p>

<p class='c011'>We give an account of one of these eruptions,
selecting that of 1766, which was remarkable for its
violence. “Four years before it took place, when
Olafsen and Povelsen were there, some of the people
were flattering themselves with the belief, that as there
had been no outbreak from the principal crater for
upwards of seventy years, its energies were completely
exhausted. Others on the contrary, thought that there
was on this account only more reason to expect that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>would soon again commence. The preceding winter
was remarkably mild, so that the lakes and rivers in the
vicinity seldom froze, and were much diminished,
probably from the internal heat. On the 4th April
1766, there were some slight shocks of an earthquake;
and early next morning a pillar of sand, mingled with fire
and red hot stones, burst with a loud thundering noise
from its summit. Masses of pumice, six feet in circumference,
were thrown to the distance of ten or fifteen
miles, together with heavy magnetic stones, one of
which, eight pounds weight, fell fourteen miles off, and
sank into the ground though still hardened by the frost.
The sand was carried towards the north-west, covering
the land, one hundred and fifty miles round, four inches
deep; impeding the fishing boats along the coast, and
darkening the air, so that at Thingore, 140 miles
distant, it was impossible to know whether a sheet of
paper was white or black. At Holum, 155 miles to the
north, some persons thought they saw the stars shining
through the sand-cloud. About mid-day, the wind
veering round to the south-east, conveyed the dust into
the central desert, and prevented it from totally
destroying the pastures. On the 9th April the lava
first appeared, spreading about five miles towards the
south-west, and on the 23d May, a column of water was
seen shooting up in the midst of the sand. The last
violent eruption was on the 5th July, the mountains in
the interval often ceasing to eject any matter; and the
large stones thrown into the air were compared to a
swarm of bees clustering round the mountain-top; the
noise was heard like loud thunder forty miles distant,
and the accompanying earthquakes were more severe at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Krisuvik, eighty miles westward, than at half the
distance on the opposite side. The eruptions are said to
be in general more violent during a north or west wind
than when it blows from the south or east, and on this
occasion more matter was thrown out in mild than in
stormy weather. Where the ashes were not too thick, it
was observed that they increased the fertility of the
grass fields, and some of them were carried even to the
Orkney islands, the inhabitants of which were at first
terrified by what they considered showers of “black
snow.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>This mountain, with its pits of burning sulphur and
mud, and openings from whence issue smoke and flames,
is associated with the old superstitions of the Icelanders
as the entrance to the dark abode of Hela, and those
gloomy regions of woe where the souls of the wicked are
tormented with fire. Nor are these ideas to be wondered
at in connection with the terrible phenomena of such an
Inferno.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Hekla lay gleaming peacefully in the sunshine,
with a heavier mantle of snow, we are told, than usual,
I bade adieu to it by attempting yet another sketch
from the pony’s back, pulling the rein for five minutes,
and then galloping on after my companions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having rounded the shoulder of the hill, we now lost
sight of Hekla and the greater part of the plain. In a
region where some brushwood and a few flowers grew
among dark coloured rocks, we came upon a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>example of ropy looking lava, curiously wrinkled in
cooling, and all corrugated in wavy lines. Soon afterwards
we saw a sloping mass of rock, some sixty feet
square, inclined at an angle of 25°, polished smooth by
the ice-drift, and deeply abraded in grooves, all running
southwards. The marks were not to be mistaken, and
were more distinct than those we had observed in
coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here I gathered specimens of geraniums and other
flowers, placing them between the leaves of my pocket
Wordsworth. Coming to a glade of dwarf willows, we
observed bees feeding on the flowers of the flossy species,
and were forthwith, even in this northern region, reminded
of Mount Hybla, recalling Virgil’s line,</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>LAKE OF THINGVALLA.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Professor, Mr. Murray, and I, riding together,
now reached and descended the Hrafnagjá or Raven’s
Chasm, which has already been described. It was
steeper than a stair, full of breaks and irregular turns.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>At some places, the ponies drew up their hind legs and
slid down. It seems more perilous to descend than to
climb such places, but the ponies are very sure-footed.
On a bosky slope, I pulled the bridle and made a sketch
of the lake of Thingvalla, the waters of which were
intensely blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Crossing the plain of Thingvalla, we reached our
rendezvous—the Pastor’s house—about nine o’clock at
night, after a splendid day’s ride; some of us, much to
our own surprise, being not only in excellent spirits, but
fresh and in good physical condition; rough-riding feats
and prolonged fatigues notwithstanding. We dined on
trout, soup, &#38;c.; and at 20 minutes to 11 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> I wandered
out, alone, to the Althing to sketch and gather flowers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The three lost ponies, that strayed from the Geysers,
have just come in. I see them now scampering before
the guide and passing the waterfall of the <a id='tn140'></a>Oxerá, which
thunders over the black rock-wall, about half a mile
from the descent into the Almannagjá. The fall looks
like a square sheet of burnished silver from the sacred
Lögberg or Hill of Laws, on which I now sit writing,
entrenched and moated round with deep volcanic chasms
about two-thirds filled with clear water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Skialdbreid—or Broadshield—Jökul, to the north-west,
is mottled towards its base with black patches, but
its summit and flanks are lit up with pure roseate light.
Armannsfell, one of a range nearer and more to the
north, is of a dark rich venetian red colour touched with
bronze and exhibits a living glow, an effect I have never
elsewhere seen equalled or even approached. Whereever
the light falls, all is transfigured and glorious
beyond description; yet there is no approach to hardness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>either of line or tint, but an atmosphere of subduing
softness, transparency, and purity, magically invests
everything with an etherial spiritual beauty: such effects
are peculiar to Iceland.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having made a sketch of the lake, I retired to rest,
the last of our party. We slept, without undressing, in
our old quarters—on the floor of the pastor’s parlour.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Tuesday morning.</i>—Rose between five and six
o’clock, and went out to gather ferns—<i>aspidium</i> or
<i>crystoperis</i>—on the Althing. The scene around was
singularly wild, and yet strikingly picturesque in its
desolate strangeness; while the tender green of the valley
itself afforded a refreshing rest to the eye. On returning
I made a sketch of the priest’s house;<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> examined
the site of the little church which was being re-erected;
strolled down by the river side, and performed my
ablutions in it—laying my clothes in the priest’s fishing
coble, which was lying hauled up on the bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>I then paused at the simple churchyard close by, and
tried to conjure up life and heart histories for those who
had entered this “Saula-hleith”—or soul-gate, as the
churchyard is beautifully named—while hymns were
being chanted over them, and who were now resting
peacefully beneath the green sod.</p>

<p class='c011'>Conversation with the pastor was again attempted to be
carried on in Latin. His morning salutation was “bonus
dies,” or other remarks about the weather, as with ourselves.
After squaring accounts, on leaving, we gave him—as
a <i>nimbus</i> for the rix-dollars—a mediaeval “pax-vobiscum,”
in exchange for his many expressions of good-will
towards us, and his rounded classical “vale!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>The glebe hay was being tedded, but the ground here
as elsewhere is covered with little hummocks. Were it
only levelled and drained, the soil, one would think,
should raise turnips in quantity, and, certainly, larger hay
crops would be obtained. During the short summer
there is not time for the grain to ripen; but food suitable
for cattle might readily be grown in the valleys; for it
is chiefly by the rearing of stock, that Iceland, when she
can muster the requisite enterprise and activity, will, in
all probability, advance to commercial prosperity.</p>

<p class='c011'>After sketching the gorge of the Almannagjá—see
illustration, p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>—we ascended it, crossed the lava
plateau, and rapidly retraced our steps to the capital,
only pausing now and again to take a sketch.</p>

<p><span class='small'>ICELANDIC FARM.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Over the last part of our journey, from the river which
we forded just below the farm house on the hill, to
Reykjavik, we rode like the wind—men and horses alike
eager to get to the end of their journey. Our entry into
the town was a regular scrimmage. It was a quarter to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>three <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> when we got in, having done the distance from
Thingvalla in six hours. By this time we had ceased to
wonder at any feats performed by the ponies. Seldom,
if ever, disconcerted, they go at anything in a most
patient philosophical manner, and get over difficulties
which elsewhere one would think insurmountable, and
sheer madness to attempt. Thanks to mackintosh overboots—made
specially for the purpose—at the end of the
journey, I was the only one of our party whose feet
were dry.</p>

  <h2 id='ch4' class='c010'><span class='xxlarge'>REYKJAVIK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Bushby invited us to dine with him at the hotel,
and Dr. Mackinlay kindly gave us his room to dress in.</p>

<p class='c011'>How oddly things sometimes turn up! We saw lying
on the floor a box of “Brown and Polson’s Patent Corn
Flour,” which at once suggested two very different, although
not incongruous, trains of ideas; one, the contrast
between the hurry and bustle of railway stations in
Britain, where the corn flour is everywhere so extensively
advertised, and the primitive locomotion of Iceland, in
which not a single steam engine has been erected; and the
other, associating the beautiful locality where the flour
is made—near Paisley, at the foot of “the Braes of
Gleniffer” celebrated in song by Tannahill, one of Scotland’s
sweetest minstrels—with some of the loveliest
scenes we had lately witnessed. For here, are we not in
the land of Eddas and Sagas! and is not the Poet found
singing wherever there are human hearts!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>A gentleman told me, that having obtained permission,
he had, that afternoon, caught seventy trout in the
salmon river—three of them from his pony’s back; he
had only to throw the fish over his head on the grass
behind him, as fast as he could whip them up. He had
seen a fisherman get 130 at one haul of the net. I saw
the manager of the fishery, an active intelligent Scotchman,
whom, from his appearance, one would take to be
the mate of a vessel. He told me he had been three
years in Iceland, and had some of his family here with
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bushby procured us several specimens of double
refracting Iceland spar, obtained from the other side of
the island. It polarizes light, and is valuable in various
ways, both to science and the arts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Murray and Mr. Cleghorn set out after dinner to
visit the sulphur mines of Krisuvik; I, on the principle
of letting well alone, preferred remaining at Reykjavik
to undergoing the fresh fatigue of such a ride immediately
after the Geyser journey. Three of us spent the
evening, by invitation, at the Governor’s—the Count
Von Trampe. I had a long conversation with him in
German, during which he mentioned that all the old
Saga and Edda MSS. had been removed to Copenhagen;
and, in answer to sundry enquiries, told me that the
“lang spiel” is the only Icelandic musical instrument
now in use. It is something like a guitar or banjo,
has four strings, and is played with a little bow. The
airs now played are chiefly Danish dance music, and
other foreign melodies.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Icelanders, like the natives of Madagascar, have
adopted the music of our “<i>God save the Queen</i>” as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>their national air. The words to which it is sung were
composed in the beginning of the present century, by
the late Biarni Thorarensen, Governor of the northern
province of the island, when he was a student at the
university of Copenhagen. The song is called “Islands
Minni,” or the “Remembrance of Iceland;” and finely
illustrates the intense love of country displayed by
Icelanders, who, wherever they may travel or sojourn,
always sooner or later return home though but to
die; for to them, as their own proverb has it, “Iceland
is the best land on which the sun shines.” We here
give the words of this national song, which, calling up
in foreign lands memories of sweet home, is no less
to the Icelander, than is the <i>Ranz de Vaches</i> to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Swiss when far away from the one chalet he loves best
in the world, perched, it may be, on the lofty mountain
side, or lying peacefully in some green sunny valley.</p>

<p class='c021'>One or two old Icelandic airs linger amongst the
people, but are seldom heard; and as there was—so
I understood the Governor to say—no musical notation
to hand them down, little reliance can be placed on
their accurate transmission.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was introduced to the Compte d’Ademas of the
<i>Artemise</i> frigate, an officer who speaks English well.
He is Lord Dufferin’s cousin. There were several
other French officers present. After leaving the Governor’s,
we called for M. <a id='tn148a'></a>Randröp, the state’s apothecary,
who received us in the wonted hospitable Icelandic manner.
Madam <a id='tn148b'></a>Randröp kindly played to us on the piano-forte
“Robin Adair,” “Cheer Boys,” “Fin chan dal
vino,” “Hear me, Norma,” a Danish dance, and an Icelandic
song. Her two daughters, the Misses Müller,
are learning English, and her son is going south by our
steamer to attend the university at Copenhagen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>The <i>Arcturus</i> having left the bay and gone somewhere
for cargo, and the few bedrooms upstairs at the hotel
being all occupied, as it was late, we resolved to sleep
down stairs on the narrow sofa-seat which runs round
the assembly room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through a large door, that opened into the billiard-room,
came the loud clicking of ivory balls, noisy vociferations
from the French sailors, and strong fumes of
tobacco; notwithstanding which, we somehow contrived
to fall asleep, and knew no more till the morning, when
we beheld blue-eyed flaxen-haired Thea, the maid-of-all-work,
standing before us. She was clad in a close fitting
dress of home-made stuff, wore the common little jaunty
black cap with its silver ornament and long silk tassel
flowing down at the side of her head, and her waist-belt
was covered with richly-wrought filigreed bossy silver
ornaments.</p>

<p class='c011'>She brought in a cup of coffee and milk and a biscuit,
depositing them on a little table which she placed beside
my long narrow couch. This good old Norse custom
is called “the little breakfast;” and, from the experience
of years, I can testify that in no way does it interfere
with or spoil the regular breakfast which follows, while
the benefit at the time is undeniable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then followed water, soap and towels, indicating that
we were expected to get up; and as breakfast was to be
served in the apartment where we lay, Thea’s hint was
speedily taken.</p>

<p class='c011'>After breakfast I called for Mr. Sivertsen, who procured
for me some coarse mits, made with two thumbs
but no finger-divisions. These are the customary wear
of the fishermen, who, when the line cuts the one side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>are thus enabled to turn them and use the other. I also
obtained a curious snuff box like a bottle,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> made of walrus-tooth;
a collection of stuffed birds, with a large black
skua, a pair of Richardson’s skua-gulls, a pair of jer-falcons,
an eider duck and drake, a puffin, an arctic gull,
and a pair of pheasant-tailed ducks among them; also
silver bracelets and brooches of exquisite workmanship.
These trinkets are made of Danish dollars by native
silver-smiths, who have certainly arrived at great proficiency
in their art.</p>

<p class='c011'>I found that the few English Testaments I had brought
with me to give away, were greatly prized by those who
were acquiring our language; the cheapest edition of the
New Testament in Icelandic costs between three and
four shillings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Last night Captain Launay, of the <i>Agile</i> French
war brig, had called at the hotel and invited us to visit
him, on board his vessel, to-day at 11 o’clock. At the
appointed time we went down to the jetty and found a
ten-oared boat waiting for us. Our party consisted of
Dr. Mackinlay, Captain Forbes, Mr. Haycock, Rector
Jonson and his daughter, Professor Chadbourne, and
myself. We were kindly received and shown over the
brig; everything on board was neat and clean; the
sailors were, for the most part, diminutive in size, like
Maltese, and, although lithe and agile, wanted the
physical build and stamina of British sailors. The men
were at mess and seemed to be well cared for.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the captain’s cabin, cakes, bonbons, and champagne
were produced, and we were entertained by the
officers with that frank and graceful hospitality peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>to the French. Captain Launay showed us collections of
geological specimens from Faröe, from the east of
Iceland, and also from the neighbourhood of Reykjavik;
all kept distinctly separated, and laudably labelled as
such specimens ever ought to be. He offered me what
of them I wished, and then addressing Professor Chadbourne,
added, “Take all, and leave me one, I am only
an amateur”! He gave me some Faröese sea-weeds of
his own preserving, and I also accepted one or two little
geological specimens as mementos of a pleasant hour
spent with one who is deservedly a favourite with all
who know him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sailors, he told me, called him Captain Long-life,
because he has been five years in the north without
losing a man. His present crew is a hundred, but
during that period, he has, one way and another, passed
a thousand men through his hands. This happy result
he attributes partly to the regular use of lime juice,
which he flavours and renders palatable by mixing it
with a little brandy or rum. The addition of the spirits
adds nothing to its virtue, probably the reverse, but the
sailors like it so, and are thus induced to take it. In
many ships, he added, the men, if not watched, throw it
over their heads into the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>A boat came alongside with an invitation from Captain
Véron for us also to visit his frigate the <i>Artemise</i>.
It has a crew of 250. The men were at mess between-decks;
and, both seats and tables being swung, the perpendicular
ropes made the whole look not unlike the
floor of a great factory. An officer took me over the
ship and through the stores. What an immense establishment
is a war ship!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The French officers are well paid, and have a handsome
allowance per day for mess, over and above their
pay. On this station they have double pay, are put to
little expense, consequently save money fast, and get
leave of absence now and again to go home and spend
it. Here we were again offered champagne but declined
it; and, at half-past one <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, were rowed ashore in a
ten oared gig, much pleased with the kind frank attentions
of all the officers.</p>

<p class='c011'>When we landed I called for Mr. Sivertsen, and afterwards
visited the library with Dr. Mackinlay. The Rev.
Olaf Pálsson dean and rector of the cathedral, and Mr.
Jón Arnason, secretary to the Bishop and also librarian,
were there before us by appointment and kindly gave
us every information we required. There were no manuscripts
to be seen here older than the fifteenth century,
and these were chiefly genealogies, or translations of
mediæval tales or romances such as “Charlemagne.”
We saw a fine folio edition of Snorro Sturleson’s writings,
and hastily looked over the work on Iceland got up
by the French expedition under Gaimard. It embraces
views of places, natural history, manners and customs,
costumes &#38;c. Some views of localities we had visited
were very good, but others were inaccurate and careless,
being only modified compositions instead of faithful
representations of the places indicated. Ere leaving, I
received several original little works, in Icelandic, both
from the dean and the librarian; those from the former
were inscribed in English “with the author’s best
respects;” and those from the latter with a legend
of similar import in Icelandic.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the althing or parliament, which ceased to meet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>at Thingvalla in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1800, was now assembled here, we
went to see it. The place of meeting is an oblong hall
in the same building as the college. You enter by the
side, and see, facing you, a raised platform where the
president and two or three officials sit at a table covered
with papers and writing materials. Portraits in oil of the
King and Queen of Denmark hung behind them. On
two rows of seats, like school forms with simple spar
backs, sit the members, forming an oblong square around
the table; visitors find places outside this square.
There are several writing desks and other conveniencies
in the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most of the deputies were sturdy intelligent
looking men—peasant-farmers dressed in brass buttoned
wadmal jackets, and wearing cow-skin shoes. On rising
to speak, many of them expressed themselves in an
animated manner, which seemed to us, with the aid of
Mr. Brynjúlfsson’s explanations and interpretations, to
be at once fluent, pointed, eloquent, and effective.</p>

<p class='c011'>The population of Iceland is, as already stated,
64,603. Parliament meets every second year, and is
composed of a deputy from each of the eighteen syssels
or counties into which the island is divided, and six
deputies, generally officials, nominated by the King.
The members are elected by household suffrage, but, on
account of the great distances, and the bad roads, few
people care to vote. Dr. Mackinlay mentioned one case,
at last election, where a member had only one single
vote—and that his own!! This indifference to matters
political, as contrasted with the stirring old times when
the Althing was supreme—being then both deliberative
and executive, “parliament and high court of justice in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>one”—may be accounted for, by the fact that it does
not now possess legislative power. The result of its
deliberations is merely a petition to the King, suggesting
that certain things should be done; and only under
certain circumstances, can they levy taxes or recommend
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The island is divided into three governments, each
government being in civil matters quite independent of
the others. The governor or stiftsamptsman who resides
at Reykjavik, is at the head of the civil administration,
“conducts all public affairs, presides in the supreme
courts of justice, watches over the execution of the laws,
the collecting and expenditure of the public revenue,
and, along with the Bishop, directs the school, and
appoints the clergy” throughout the whole island. The
governor is sometimes a native of the island, though
oftener a Dane. “He continues in office five years, with
a salary of about £300 per annum, and is entitled to
promotion on his return to Denmark. Under him are
the <a id='tn154'></a>amptmen, of whom there ought to be four, but as the
governor holds this office in the southern province, and
the northern and eastern are united, there are only two
others. These have the superintendence of the inferior
officers, and nearly the same duties in their province as
the governor exercises in relation to the whole island.
Subordinate to them are the sysselmen or sheriffs,
nineteen in number, who are empowered to hold courts,
appoint justices of the peace and notaries, and to
administer the laws concerning inheritances. They are
chosen by the crown from among the principal
proprietors in the district. Under these are the hrepp-stiorar
or bailiffs, who assist the sheriff in preserving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the peace and public order, and have at the same time,
the charge of the poor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All causes civil and criminal, come in the first
instance before the sysselman in the Heradsthing, one of
which is held regularly, once in twelve months, though
extraordinary sessions are also called. This court
consists of the sheriff as judge, with four assistants
named meddomsmen. The landfoged or steward, who
is receiver-general of the island, and police-master of
Reykjavik, holds a similar court in that town. From
their decision there is an appeal to the highest tribunal,
instituted in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1800, on the suppression of the
althing, and which consists of the governor as president,
who takes no part in the proceedings, a chief-justice,
two assessors, a secretary, and two public pleaders.
Cases are here decided according to the native laws, or
Jonsbook, introduced in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1280, and the latter royal
ordinances; and from their judgment the last appeal
lies to the supreme court of Copenhagen. The high
moral character of the people renders the last court
nearly a sinecure,—not more than six or eight cases,
public or private, occurring annually. The crimes are
mostly sheep-stealing and small thefts, and the only
punishments inflicted in the country are whipping or
fines. Those condemned to hard labour are sent to
Copenhagen; and a peasant, being capitally convicted
many years ago, for murdering his wife, it was found
necessary to carry him to Norway for execution.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The taxes collected in the island, being very inconsiderable,
impose little burthen on the inhabitants. They
are principally levied on property according to several
old customs; and payment is chiefly made in produce of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>various kinds, which is converted into money by the
sysselman, and transmitted, after deducting a third for
his own salary, to the landfoged or treasurer. The
whole amount does not exceed 50,000 rix-dollars, and
does not even suffice for the support of the civil government
of the island.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The machinery of civil government is well arranged;
but the people are peaceable, and to a large extent
govern themselves; thus rendering the duties of the
officials very light. In reference to this pleasant state
of matters, Dr. Mackinlay quaintly remarked, “Each
country is presided over by a sysselman or sheriff, who,
besides his judicial duties, has to discharge the duties of
lord lieutenant and revenue officer, postmaster, poorlaw
guardian and head constable. As the average population
of each syssel is only 3700, he has, after
discharging all his duties, time enough on hand to be
his own clerk and message boy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>At five o’clock, Dr. Mackinlay, Mr. Haycock, Dr.
Livingston, Professor Chadbourne, and myself, dined at
the hotel, with Gísli Brynjúlfsson, Mr. Bushby, and
Captain Forbes; it was our last dinner at Reykjavik.
The <i>Arcturus</i> is to sail with us to-night at ten o’clock
for the east of the island. All last things have a touch of
sadness about them; we have been happy together, and
shall not likely all meet again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Murray and Mr. Cleghorn have not yet returned
from Krisuvik. Gísli Brynjúlfsson the poet is an
M.P., and at present here to attend the althing. He is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>employed, as already mentioned, by the government at
Copenhagen in connection with Icelandic antiquities
and literature, and has a work on these subjects in preparation.
He speaks English fluently, and gave us
much interesting information.</p>

<p class='c011'>After dinner Dr. Mackinlay called with me for Mr. Jón
Gudmundsson, editor of the “<a id='tn157'></a>Thióthólfr,” a Reykjavik
newspaper—a quarto sheet of 8 pp.—in which, along with
other news, the proceedings of the althing now sitting
are reported in a condensed form. No particular time is
fixed for publication, so that it appears at irregular intervals
when there is news to communicate. Mr. Gudmundsson
is an advocate, and holds an official appointment
in the althing. He presented us with several
numbers of his paper. The type is clear and the
paper good, so that it and another Reykjavik newspaper
the “Islendingur,” a folio of 8 pp.,—both printed at the
same government office—are without exception the most
beautifully printed newspapers I ever saw anywhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Mr. Gudmundsson’s house we saw medallions of
Finn Magnusen, Finnsen, and other distinguished Icelanders.
He was exceedingly polite and courteous, but,
as we knew he must be much occupied at present, we
made our visit a short one.</p>

<p class='c011'>We then saw Dr. Hjaltalin, chief physician of the
island, and well known for his antiquarian and scientific
acquirements. He and Rector Jonson are good, tall,
portly specimens of humanity. The latter good-naturedly
told me that when some one called him a John Bull,
although he did not quite understand the phrase, he
knew that it somehow associated him with England, and,
for that reason, felt “flattered—very much flattered!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Our friends returned while we were making calls, and
describe their moonlight ride of thirty miles to Krisuvik
as more like a wild dream of chaos than a reality. Their
path lay among lava chasms, along the tops of narrow
lava ridges, irregularly jugged like a saw; through huge
lava blocks, like ten thousand Stonehenges huddled together;
over volcanic sand and cinder heaps; over hollow
lava domes, and through great burst lava bubbles,
or extinct craters. Lava everywhere, parts seemed like
a troubled sea which had been suddenly spelled into
stone, and then roasted, baked and cracked. This scene
has been aptly characterized by an old traveller as “a
congealed pandemonium.” In a boggy valley were seen
several boiling mud-caldrons, which exhale sulphurious
fumes. These gases condense in the atmosphere and
deposit a crust of sulphur, in layers of various thickness,
on the coloured clay banks on the side of the hill. Many
jets of steam and smoke rose around; while on their
right lay the lovely blue lake of <a id='tn158'></a>Kleifervatn. Mr. Bushby
had kindly furnished them with a letter to his agent,
which procured for them such shelter and creature comforts
as his iron house could afford.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now about 9 o’clock; and, not without sincere
regret, on pushing off from the shore, did we bid adieu
to those kind-hearted, learned, yet simple-minded gentlemen
at Reykjavik, who had done so much to make our
visit to their island a pleasant one.</p>

<p class='c011'>While some ponies were being taken on board from
a large boat alongside, the steam was suddenly blown
off; the noise frightening them, one jumped into the sea
and swam ashore, a distance of a mile, with a boat after
it. However it was got on board again, none the worse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>for its adventure. It turned out to be a pony which Mr.
Murray had purchased, and was taking south with him
to Long-yester.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <a id='tn159'></a>Brynjúlfsson had accompanied me to the steamer,
and, before starting, Mr. Arnason also came on board to
bid us another adieu!</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'>At ten o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, <i>August 3</i>, the anchor was heaved
and we sailed for the east of the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bay at Reykjavik is very lovely. Every crevice
of the Essian mountains is distinctly shown; while the
positive colours and delicate tints of these and other
heights rising far inland, which the eye takes in, in
sweeping round the semicircle from Snæfell to Skagi, are
bright, varied, and beautiful beyond description. Deep
indigoes dashed with purple, violet peaks, pale lilac
ranges; and, relieved against them, cones of dazzling
snow and ice glittering like silver, side by side with rosy
pinks and warm sunny browns, all rising over a foreground
of black lava. The sky overhead is blue; and
the northern horizon lit up with a mellow glow of golden
light.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>The frigate <i>Artemise</i>, the brig <i>Agile</i>, the Danish
schooner <i>Emma</i>, and several trading vessels lying at
anchor, animate the scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>Snæfell Jökul—rising to the north-west on the extreme
of yonder narrow ridge that runs out due west
into the sea for nearly fifty miles, separating the Faxa
from the Breida fiord—dome-shaped, isolated and perpetually
covered with snow, is now touched with living
rosy light.</p>

<p class='c011'>At its foot lie the singular basaltic rocks of Stappen,
somewhat like the Giant’s Causeway, or the island of
Staffa in the Hebrides. Indeed, stapp is the same word
as staff, and indicates the character of the columnar formation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For the first time, since leaving home, we see the stars.
One or two, only, are shining in the quivering blue overhead,
with a quiet, subdued, pale golden light. I made
a sketch of Snæfell as it appeared from the quarter deck
of the steamer at a distance of fifty miles; it seemed a
low cone rising from the sea. As the evening was calm
and beautiful, ere retiring, we walked the deck till a late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>hour, musing on the structure and marvellous phenomena
of this half-formed chaotic island, where Frost and Fire
still strive for the mastery before our very eyes.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>August 4.</i>—On getting upon deck, I found we were
past Cape Reykjanes, and making for the Westmanna
Islands. Eldey—the rock like a meal-sack—lies, in the
distance, far astern.</p>

<p class='c011'>My place at table is between Dr. Mackinlay and Mr.
Haycock, the latter being next the chairman Rector
Jonson who is going to Copenhagen; Mr. Murray, Mr.
Cleghorn, Professor Chadbourne and Dr. Livingston sit
opposite. The Danes are all congregated at the other
end of the table with the captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half-past three <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Saw Eyafialla Jökul, and
Godalands Jökul, Myrdals Jökul, and Kötlugjá. These
form part of the most southern range of snow-mountains
in the island, and rise distinctly over a dark greenish
and purple range of hills, away to the east on our port
bow. Eyafialla is the second highest mountain in Iceland,
being next in height to Oræfa Jökul. It has a
distinct crater. Only one violent eruption, that of <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1612, is recorded previous to <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1821. “But on the
night between the 20th and 21st December, of that
year, the lofty Eyafialla Jökul, of which the movement
of <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1612, was the only one formerly known, burst its
icy covering, and began to cast out ashes, stones, and
dust, accompanied with a strong flame. It continued
till January throwing out great quantities of pumice
ashes, which covered all the surrounding fields; and in
February 1822, a lofty pillar of smoke still rose from the
crater. In June of the following year it again began to
burn, and on the 26th of the same month, destroyed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>part of the adjacent land; but after pouring out some
streams of water, in the beginning of July, it was once
more quiet. In this month also the Kötlugjá, after
sixty-eight years repose, threw out sand and ashes,
covering nearly one hundred square miles of ground.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Kötlugjá—the gjá, fissure, or chasm of Kötlu—is
not a separate mountain with a crater, but simply a
yawning rent, so large as to resemble an extensive
valley, situated on the north-west shoulder of Myrdals-Jökul,
which is a lofty ice-mountain. From its inaccessibility
it has never been explored, having been only
examined from a distance. The rent is visible from the
sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Records of volcanic eruptions occurring throughout
the island have, in general, been carefully kept by the
Icelanders from the earliest times; but in this case, from
the proximity of numerous other volcanic vents, and the
distance of the spectators, along with the long continued
and intermittent nature of single eruptions—sometimes
lasting for years—there appears to be some confusion in
the various accounts, which renders it difficult to reckon
the number of</p>

<h3 id='ch5s1' class='c025'><span class='xlarge'><a id='tn163a'></a>KÖTLUGJÁ’S ERUPTIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>The first outbreak, which, by the way, is the earliest
recorded date of an eruption in the island—being before
<a id='tn163b'></a>Eldborg to which that honour is usually assigned—occurred
in the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 894, and the last in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1823.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>The number of them during that period is reckoned by
the best authorities at fourteen, the longest interval between
two eruptions being 311 years, and the shortest 6.
As its devastations have only been less terrible than
those of Skaptár, we shall now, after presenting a concise
table of dates, glance at the various eruptions of Kötlugjá,
extracting or briefly condensing from reliable
sources, dwelling more particularly on those of <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1625,
and 1755, two of the most fearful and destructive.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first eruption, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 894, destroyed the pasture
lands between the hill called Hafrsey, and the Holmsá
river. Eight farms were abandoned, and the district of
country in question is still almost entirely a sandy desert.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 934, was also a formidable one, and
formed the extensive sandy desert now known as the
Solheima-sand, a tract about twenty miles long; and
formed altogether of volcanic sand, ashes, or lapilli, and
pumice.</p>

<p class='c011'>The third, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1245, covered a tract of country,
though of what extent we are not informed, with sand
and ashes to the depth of six or eight inches.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>The fourth, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1262, or, according to some writers,
1263, was attended by such an ejection of dust and
ashes, that the sun could not be seen at mid-day in serene
weather. During this eruption, the large river called
Fulilækr, the Jökulsá—or Jökul river—which divides
the Skoga-sand from the Solheima-sand, suddenly made
its appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fifth, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1311 (some say 1332), appears to
have been more destructive to life than any of the previous
ones. Many farms were destroyed in the district
called Myrdals-sand; several sand-hills and other hills
were formed, and several marshes sprang into existence.
It vomited ashes and sand during the greater part of
the winter, and, melting the ice about the crater, the inhabited
tract in the vicinity was inundated, and all the
inhabitants except two perished in the flood. Another
account states that this eruption was known as “<i>Sturluhlaup</i>,”
from only <i>one man</i> of the name of Sturla
having been saved, of those overwhelmed by the volcanic
ejections.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sixth, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1416. The lava or <a id='tn166a'></a>water-floods took
the direction of Hjörleifshöfdi, an isolated hill and promontory
on the coast of the Myrdals-sand, considerably
to the south-east of <a id='tn166b'></a>Kötlugjá.</p>

<p class='c011'>The seventh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1580. During this eruption it is
stated that Myrdals Jökul was rent asunder, and as the
name Kötlugjá is now first given to the crater or fissure
of eruption, it is probable that at this date the chasm was
first recognised or discovered, if not formed. This eruption
was characterized by fire, darkness, and a rain of
ashes, as well as by <a id='tn166c'></a>water-floods; one of which latter went
eastward toward the monastery of Thyckvaboe, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>another southward to Myrdal. Many farms were destroyed,
but there appears to have been no loss of
human life.</p>

<p class='c011'>The eighth, in 1612, was attended, it is conjectured,
by a subsidence to some extent of the Fall-Jökul, which
is situated between <a id='tn167a'></a>Eyafialla and Myrdals Jökul, as well
as of the lower lands between Langanes and Thorsmerkr.
The accompanying fire was such, that the eruption was
visible extensively in the north of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ninth, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1625, was “one of the grandest and
most devastating eruptions of Kötlugjá that has ever
occurred.<a id='tn167c'></a>” Its historian is Thorsteinn Magnússon, at the
time sysselman or sheriff of <a id='tn167b'></a>Skaptafells-syssel (or district),
who lived in the monastery of Thyckvaboe. His account
was published in Copenhagen in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1627. According
to him, ‘at daybreak on the second of September it began
to thunder in the Jökul; and about 8 o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> floods
of water and ice were poured down upon the low country,
and carried away upwards of 200 loads of hay<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> which lay
in the fields about Thyckvaboe. These floods continued
to be poured forth like a raging sea till past one o’clock
in the afternoon, when they gradually diminished, but
were succeeded by terrible darkness, earthquakes, thunder,
flames, and showers of sand. Nor was it in the
immediate vicinity of the crater alone that the fire
appeared, but down in the inhabited tract, at the distance
of nearly twenty miles from the mountain, igneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>vapours were seen attaching themselves to the clothes of
the inhabitants. (?) This dreadful scene continued, with
little variation, till the 13th of the month. It was frequently
so clear at night that the mountains, with all
their clefts and divisions, were seen as distinctly at the
distance of twenty miles as they were in the clearest day.
Sometimes the flames were pure as the sun, sometimes
they were red, and at others they discovered all the
colours of the rainbow. The lightenings were visible
now in the air, and now running over the surface of the
ground; and <i>such as witnessed them were more or less
affected in such parts of their bodies as were uncovered</i>.
[!] These flashes were accompanied by the
loudest claps of thunder, and darted backwards and forwards;
now to the ground, and now into the air, dividing
sometimes into separate bolts, each of which appeared
to be followed by a separate report; and after shooting
in different directions, they instantly collected again,
when a dreadful report was heard, and the igneous
appearance fell like a waterspout to the ground, and became
invisible. While the showers of sand lasted, it
was frequently so dark in the day time that two individuals
holding each other by the hand could not discover
each other’s face.’ Dr. Hjaltalin states that the water-floods,
bearing large masses of ice, ‘surrounded the
monastery of Thyckvaboe, with its adjacent farms, one
of which was overflowed by the stream; but the people
saved themselves on a high hill, where the flood could
not reach them. The flood was followed by such heavy
shots and continual thunder, that the people thought the
heavens would burst to pieces, and they were surrounded
with continual flashes of lightning. The pasturages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>were so covered with ashes and pumice, that cattle,
horses, and sheep could not get any food, and were seen
running about in wild confusion. During the eruption
such a darkness prevailed sometimes that days were
darker than nights; and it is related that showers of
ashes from this eruption reached the town of Bergen in
Norway, which is the greatest distance to which volcanic
ashes were ever thrown from Iceland.’ The account in
the ‘Islendingur’ of June 16, p. 45, mentions further,
that the mixed water and ice flood flowed in cascades
and waves over Myrdals-sand; that the inhabitants fled
to the heights for safety; that the depth of the water-flood,
which surrounded the monastery of Thyckvaboe,
was such that a large ocean-vessel might have sailed between
the byres and the principal building, and that
there was an excessive falling of sand in the district to
the north-east of Kötlugjá, called the Skaptártunga.
This eruption thus lasted for about twelve days, wholly
destroying many farms, and partially destroying or rendering
temporarily useless others. The damage done
was greatest in the low lands to east, north-east, and
south-east of Kötlugjá.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tenth, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1660—commencing on 3d November—“appears
scarcely to have been less formidable than the
preceding eruption. Water-floods overwhelmed and destroyed
the farm and church of Höfdabrekka, which
latter was cast into the sea immediately adjoining, apparently
by an earthquake-shock. Only such articles
were saved from the building as could, at the moment,
be snatched away by the clergyman Jón Salamonsson.
The quantity of sand, ashes, and sulphur, thrown out
and deposited on the coast about Höfdabrekka was such,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>that what formerly was a depth of twenty fathoms of
sea water, became at once dry land. Such is the
account in the ‘Islendingur.’ Dr. Hjaltalin says the
clouds of pumice, ashes, and sand, rendered the
atmosphere, in the vicinity of Kötlugjá, very dark
during nine days. Many farms were destroyed.
Flames and ashes were ejected during the greater part
of winter. Henderson asserts, that ‘the quantity of ice,
&#38;c., carried down by the inundation, was so great, that
where it was deposited, it rose to the height of forty-nine
fathoms above the surface of the former depositions.
The church of Höfdabrekka’ constructed wholly of wood,
and of limited dimensions, ‘was observed to swim
among the masses of ice, to a considerable distance in
the sea, ere it fell to pieces.’ The volcano appears, with
some intermission, to have erupted sand the two
following years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The eleventh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1721, began at nine <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on the
11th May. Dr. Hjaltalin says “the narrative of this
eruption proceeds from certain of the inhabitants of the
<i>north of Iceland</i>, who observed the phenomena from
the distance of about 100 English miles! These distant
witnesses, state that the eruption was preceded
by heavy shots, like shots of artillery, lasting less or
more for several days, and distinctly heard by them in
the north of the island. These sounds were followed
by a heavy fire—which expression seems translateable as
<i>vivid flames</i>—also visible at the great distance above
named. The flames or fire were followed by clouds of
ashes, so dense and so extensive, as to have produced
complete darkness for some hours, at the remoteness of
80 or 100 miles.” “The ‘Islendingur’ refers to an earthquake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>chiefly felt in Myrdal, but extending <a id='tn171a'></a>eastward to
Lidu, and <a id='tn171c'></a>westward to Fljótshlíd. About noon of the
same day—11th May—the earth became fissured at
various points; loud sounds were heard, and lastly,
flames, with steam or smoke, were seen to issue from
Kötlugjá<a id='tn171b'></a>. A water-flood now descended from the
volcano, bearing huge pieces of ice, resembling in bulk
small islands; which icebergs sailed along as rapidly as
a ship in a good breeze. These icebergs were borne by
the flood from Höfdabrekka eastward to Hjörleifshöfdi
and <a id='tn171d'></a>Hafrsey. One village was destroyed in the east of
the Myrdals-sand district.” Again, Henderson states, p.
213,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> the “inundations lasted nearly three days, and
carried along with them such amazing quantities of ice,
stones, earth, and sand, that the sea was filled with
them to the distance of three miles from the shore.
The sun was darkened by the smoke and ashes which
were thrown into the air; sand and pumice were blown
over almost the whole island; and the ice and water
desolated a considerable tract of grass land, over which
they flowed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The twelfth, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1727, is believed to have been of
little intensity or importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The eruption which follows—the thirteenth, that of
1755—is the “most celebrated of all the outbreaks of
Kötlugjá, on account alike of its grandeur, its duration,
and its frightful results—an eruption which has since
caused Kötlugjá to be dreaded by the Icelanders as one
of their most dangerous volcanoes, if not their most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>dangerous one.” It began about noon on the 17th of
October, and “continued, with intermissions, till 25th
August 1756—its duration, therefore, being nearly a year.
The ‘Islendingur’ gives a very short reference merely;
but the accounts of Dr. Hjaltalin and of Henderson are
comparatively full. According to Dr. Hjaltalin, the
eruption was preceded by a series of earthquakes,
beginning in September; they were especially severe in
the north-east of Iceland, near Cape Langanes, about
150 or 180 miles distant from Kötlugjá. In this district
they overthrew several farms; and in a milder degree
they were felt over a considerable extent of country.
The eruption itself began at ten <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> of 17th October,
about a fortnight prior to the earthquake which destroyed
Lisbon. Vivid flames shot towards the sky, accompanied
by severe earthquakes, sounds like thunder, and lightnings.
The volcano was enveloped in smoke or steam;
showers of ashes and pumice fell constantly, while volcanic
bombs were hurled high into the air. The latter must
have been of great size, for they were seen bursting, and
the accompanying detonating reports were heard at a
distance of upwards of a hundred miles. The days, it is
said, were darker than the nights; and the flames and
bombs gave so unearthly a character to the scene, that
the poor inhabitants fancied that the day of judgment
had arrived, and that our globe was bursting into atoms.
Over large tracts of <a id='tn172'></a>country, the soil was covered with
sand and ashes to a depth of two or three feet; cattle,
horses, and sheep, consequently died in great numbers.
This devastation caused a famine and pestilence among
the inhabitants, who perished by the hundred. The
eruption was violent for fourteen days. The water-floods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span><a id='tn173'></a>overflowed the district of Myrdals-sand, which is about
twenty miles long and sixteen broad. Five parishes
were more or less devastated, and fifty farms were
destroyed. These were the more local disasters; but, in
addition to this, the sand and ashes were spread over a
great portion of the island, producing fatal epidemics and
epizöotics,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and it is said even the wild-fowl fled from
many parts of the island. The earthquakes were
characterized by distinct wave-like motions of the land,
which fluctuated like an agitated ocean, and the same
earthquake-waves were propagated from the coasts outward
to sea, to the serious damage of the shipping.”
Henderson says—vol. 1. p. 314—“The inhabitants of the
track about Kötlugjá were first apprised of the impending
catastrophe on the forenoon of the 17th October, by
a number of quick and irregular tremifactions, which
were followed by three immense floods, from the Jökul,
that completely overflowed Myrdals-sand, and carried
before them almost incredible quantities of ice and
gravel. Masses of ice, resembling small mountains in
size, pushed one another forward, and bore vast pieces of
solid rock on their surface. After the rocking had continued
some time, an exceedingly loud report was heard,
when fire and water were observed to be emitted
alternately by the volcano, which appeared to vent its
rage through three apertures situated close to each other.
At times the column of fire was carried to such a
height that it illuminated the whole of the surrounding
atmosphere, and was seen at the distance of one hundred
and eighty miles; at other times the air was so filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>with smoke and ashes that the adjacent parishes were
enveloped in total darkness. Between these alternations
of light and obscurity, vast red-hot globes were thrown
to a great height, and broken into a thousand pieces.
The following night presented one of the most awful and
sublime spectacles imaginable. An unremitting noise,
like that produced by the discharge of heavy artillery,
was heard from the volcano. A fiery column of variegated
hues rose into the atmosphere; flames and sparks
were scattered in every direction, and blazed in the most
vivid manner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The eruption continued with more or less violence
till the 7th of November, during which period dreadful
<i>exundations of hot-water</i> were poured forth on the low
country; and the masses of ice, clay, and solid rock, that
they hurled into the sea, were so great that it was <i>filled
to the distance of more than fifteen miles</i>; and, in
some places, where it was formerly forty fathoms deep,
the tops of the newly deposited rocks were now seen
towering above the water. A violent eruption happened
again, on the 17th of November, when the volcano
remained inactive till the following year, during which it
emitted fire and water five times—viz., on January 15,
June 28 and 29, and August 12 and 25.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The principal damage occasioned by these eruptions,
consisted in the destruction of the pasture-grounds
throughout the most part of the syssel—or district.
Numbers of the cattle were carried away by the deluge;
and the mephitic substances, with which everything was
impregnated, brought on a raging mortality in different
parts of the country. On the breaking forth of the
water, a number of people fled for refuge to an insulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>mountain called Hafrsey, where they were obliged to
stay seven days without either meat or drink; and were
exposed to the showers of stones, fire, and water which
fell around them. The lightning, which was very violent
during the eruption, penetrated through solid rocks, and
killed two people and eleven horses, three of which were
in a stable. One of the persons killed was a farmer,
whom it struck dead as he left the door of his house.
What is remarkable, his upper clothes, which were of
wool, bore no marks of fire, but the linen he had under
them was burned; and when he was undressed, it was
found that the skin and flesh of his right side were consumed
to the very bone. [!] His maid-servant was struck
with the lightning at the same time; and though her
clothes were instantly changed, it continued to burn in
the pores of her body, and singed the clothes she put
on. [!] She died a few days afterwards, having in the
meantime suffered inexpressible pain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This eruption, Henderson very truly remarks, becomes
the more noteworthy from “the terrible convulsions to
which at the same time a great part of the terrestrial
globe was subjected. Not only were the British isles
rocked by repeated and violent shocks of an earthquake,
houses thrown down, rocks split, and the waters of the
sea and lakes<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> heaved up; but in Norway, Sweden,
Germany, Holland, France, and Italy, the same phenomena
were experienced. Spain and Portugal, however,
suffered most from the shocks. Numerous villages, convents,
and churches were demolished; the largest mountains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>shaken from the foundations, and the low grounds
inundated by the swelling and overflowing of the rivers.
Lisbon, in particular, exhibited a scene the most tragical
and melancholy. The most ponderous edifices were
heaved up and shaken; steeples, towers, and houses
thrown down; the ground and streets danced under the
feet of the inhabitants; and many thousands of them
were buried in the ruins. Nor was the earthquake confined
to Europe. It stretched over into Barbary, and
destroyed upwards of a dozen of cities on the coasts of
Africa. Its concussions were also felt in Persia, in <a id='tn176a'></a>the
West Indies, and in America.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Sir George S.
Mackenzie and Sir William Hooker<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> both also describe
this eruption in their respective works of travel, but the
incidents do not differ from those given above. The
latter writer characterizes the sounds accompanying the
eruption as “most frightful and horrible roarings.” The
illuminations at night were so vivid, “that heaven and
earth seemed to be equally in a state of conflagration.”
On the 19th of October a column of smoke issued from the
volcano, which column was black by day; but the smoke
was intermixed with balls and sparks of fire, which by
night lighted up the whole of the Myrdal district, while
the country to the east thereof was in darkness both day
and night. “Ashes fell like rain” in Faröe, 300 miles
distant, and subterranean noises were heard as far as the
<a id='tn176b'></a>Guldbringu and
Kiosar syssels—80 to 90 miles distant.<a id='tn176c'></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The fourteenth, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1823, began on the 1st and ended
on the 26th July. The phenomena were, as usual,
chiefly water-floods, showers of ashes, slight earthquakes,
and vivid lightnings, which latter struck several persons.
Only one farm, Solheimar, was destroyed, and comparatively
little damage was done elsewhere; altogether
the eruption was one of the mildest and most innocuous
hitherto recorded of Kötlugjá.</p>

<p class='c011'>These glimpses of the recorded volcanic history of
that one spot on which we now gaze, will convey to the
reader some idea of the terrific visitations to which the
islanders are exposed; even when there are not lava
streams licking up rivers, pastures, farms, and people in
their fiery floods, filling up whole valleys or rushing out
into the sea and forming capes, hissing, the while, louder
than the Midgard Serpent, which encompasses the whole
earth.</p>

<hr class='c023'>

<p class='c011'>White fleecy clouds come and go, at times muffling
the summit of these jökuls, which are deemed the
most picturesque in Iceland, if we except Snæfell on
the west coast, and Oræfa on the south-east.</p>

<p class='c011'>After passing the Westmanna islands and the east-most
mouth of the <a id='tn177a'></a>Markarfliót river, which sweeps
round the north and west sides of Eyafialla Jökul, the
south-east mountain ranges, on which we have long been
gazing, begin; the general character of the coast, north
of this point, having been low like the <a id='tn177b'></a>Guldbringu syssel.
This district has been rendered classic ground, as the
scene of Njal’s Saga,<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> and we only wish it were permitted
us to land and visit Bergthorsknoll and Lithend, to cross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the rivers, scamper over the plains, or scale the Three-corner
mountain. It is now clear, and one can take in
the general character of the whole district at a glance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The colour of the sea now assumed a light green
aspect, broken here and there by white crested waves.
Snow patches lay on the rugged purple hills; these,
again, were touched with lines of intense fiery gold,
actually excandescent. Sea-birds flitted past like white
gleams; and, altogether, the scene, flooded with golden
light, presented a magnificent study of colour. I made
jottings of the outlines, tints, and atmospheric effects, for
a water colour drawing; to be painted “some day”—that
unattainable period when so many things are to be done,
but which ever recedes from us like the horizon line;
luring us on and on, and cheating us from day to day
with a vague phantom shadow of</p>

<p class='c021'>The Skogar-foss—force or waterfall—yonder, falling
sheer over the rock cliffs into the sea, gently sways to
and fro in the wind. It falls from so great a height
that it appears to lose itself in vapour or dust, like the
Staubach. There is an old tradition that an early
colonist—Thrasi—before dying, buried a chest of gold
and jewels in the deep rock-basin into which this
magnificent sheet of water tumbles.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Sun-gleams rest on the snow-mountains and play on
the ice of the glaciers. These are very numerous near
the coast, the ice being generally of a light whity-green
colour and corrugated in wavy lines.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the weather is clear and bright, we see the coast
near Portland to more advantage than on our first
approach to the island. The wild fantastic promontories,
rock-islets, and needle shaped drongs—serrated,
peaked and hummocky—resemble the ruins of old castles
and cathedrals. The likeness of one of them to Iona,
already remarked upon, is now even still more apparent.
Behind these rocks is a low range of hills, beyond which
rise the jökuls.</p>

<p class='c011'>The summits of these mountains are white with
perpetual snow. The shoulders shade downwards into
pale green ice, which terminates abruptly at the edge of
a dark rugged precipitous line of rock that descends
sheer into the valley behind the low range of hills next
the sea. The precipice looked as if the sides of the
mountains had, in some way, been sliced down, say
from a third of their height, leaving the snowy summits
and icy shoulders untouched.</p>

<p class='c011'>Glaciers were formed, wherever the nature of the slope
would admit of them. In some instances they seemed
to approach the brink of the precipice and overhang it;
but more frequently they chose places where rents,
chasms, irregularities, or depressed spaces, occurring between
any two mountains in the range, broke the wall,
and thus afforded an incline plane all the way down to
the valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many whales continue to sport round the vessel,
spouting up jets of water, tumbling about and showing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the whole of their large tails. At times they leap nearly
altogether out of the sea, and fall with a great splash.
They often remain perfectly motionless for a considerable
time. When diving down, both the rounded shape of
the fish, and the peculiar parabolic motion with which
it rises and falls, make the ridge of the back with its
dorsal fins resemble the segment of a great black revolving
disk, like a monster saw-wheel. Gulls, skuas, and
pheasant-tailed ducks are flying about.</p>

<p class='c011'>A lot of beer-drinking and meerschaum-smoking
Danes are on board, going to Copenhagen. The smell of
tobacco is felt everywhere, above, below, and at all hours.
Their voices are frequently heard during the day calling
for “snaps.” They consider a glass of this spirit indispensible
for breakfast, and take it every morning to begin
with. However, the hours passed very pleasantly
on shipboard. The following</p>

<h3 id='ch5s2' class='c025'><span class='xlarge'>ICELANDIC STATISTICS</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>will interest the reader. From the last census—1855—we
learn that the population of the island is 64,603; of
that number 52,475 live by farming, and 5,055 by fishing,
thus accounting for nearly three-fourths of the whole
population. In exact figures the number is only 923
short of that proportion.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were then in the island 65 persons deaf and
dumb, and 202 blind. Curious to observe that, although
there previously had been and again may be, there
was not then a single watchmaker on the island. The
extreme paucity of common tradesmen—less than 11 to
the 1000—indicates a very primitive pastoral state of
society amongst the islanders; home wants being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>generally supplied by home skill. The following table
is constructed, from data contained in the census, to show
at a glance the various occupations of the Icelanders,
and also what relative proportion these bear to each
thousand of the population.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>There are only sixty-three native Icelandic surnames.
Few people have got any; the custom is, after telling
one’s own christian name, when asked whose son are
you? to answer in old Hebrew fashion, son of, or
daughter of so and so. There are 530 men’s christian
names, and 529 women’s names in use; so that there
need be no lack for choice of names in a large family.

<p class='c011'>Half-past 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Looking back to Portland <a id='tn182'></a>Huk,
over the light-green sea with its white crested waves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the reddish brown fantastic islets, and the singular
arched opening in the rock—Dyrhólaey—show distinctly
and beautifully against the amber light of the horizon.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we paced the deck, talking about the old Norse
language—which is still spoken in Iceland as it used to
be in the eighth and ninth centuries in Norway, Sweden,
and Denmark, in the Orkney, Shetland, and Faröe
islands, in the two northern counties of Scotland, and
in other Scandinavian settlements along the British
coast—Dr. Mackinlay remarked, that “so well had the
language been preserved, an Icelander of the present
day had no difficulty in understanding the most ancient
writings of his country.” This can be said of no other
tongue in western Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>To this—the very language of the Vikings—both the
old lowland Scotch, and, at a further remove, our modern
English, chiefly owe their directness, expressiveness, and
strength.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many words, which we now use with a secondary or
restricted meaning, still retain their primitive signification
in Icelandic. Thus the word “smith”—a contraction
for smiteth—which with us is restricted to a worker
in metals, in Icelandic still retains its old sense of handcraftsman.
Hence the Icelander not only talks of a
goldsmith as a guldsmidr, a silversmith as silfursmidr,
but of a saddler as södlasmidr, a cooper as a koparsmidr,
a shoemaker as a <a id='tn183'></a>skórsmidr, a joiner as a trésmidr, a
builder as a husasmidr, a printer as a prentsmidr, a
blacksmith as a jarnsmidr, a cabinet-maker as a skrinsmidr,
a watchmaker as an ursmidr, and, in a metaphorical
sense, of a poet or ode-writer as an odarsmidr; just as
the Anglo-Saxons talked of a warrior as a war-smidr.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Over a narrow strip of low sand-beach, the near snow-mountains
and icefields, like frosted silver burnished in
parts, now lie gleaming with dazzling brightness in the
sun; coloured here and there with living gem-like streaks
of opal, amber, crimson, and orange which glow yet
more intensely, as if the snow and ice had been magically
touched with an unextinguishable pencil of fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Portland point is left astern, and over it, dark clouds,
of a leaden hue and ruddy edges, came down to within
a short distance of the transparent glowing horizon. The
coast-range and islets, off the point, are deep purple,
relieved against a narrow golden belt of light below the
leaden cloud. In it, hang motionless a few cloud
streaks—light, fleecy, purplish gray—and, lower down,
others of only a lighter amber than the pure ether in
which they float.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sea is of a light sap green; the level sun-glare
slants across the wake of the steamer, and touches the
crested waves; while a line of light, like a silvery mist,
marks the edge of the sea, by running along the coast at
the foot of the snow-capped hills. Sea-gulls flying about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>are following the vessel, and screaming with delight or
expectation. All is a perfect study of colour—warm
purples, glowing ambers, fiery crimsons, and cool greens—each
heightened by neutral tints in the clouds, and
crests of white foam, little more than a ripple, on the
green sea. I walked the deck for two hours with the
captain, and turned in at eleven o’clock.</p>

<p><span class='small'>ORÆFA <a id='tn185'></a>JÖKUL.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Friday morning.</i> We are passing Oræfa Jökul,
which, by the latest measurement, rises 6,405 English
feet above the sea level, and is the highest mountain in
the island. It is an immense mass, covered with snow
and ice, and exhibiting glaciers creeping down to the sea.
Sometimes the internal heat of this volcano melts and
cracks the surface ice-mail, so that it splinters and rushes
down the sides as an avalanche of ice and water, filling
up hollows and valleys. When in action it only ejects
ashes and pumice; never lava.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> By the side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>mountain is a gently sloping snow-field, with several
pointed black peaks rising abruptly out of it. This field
stretches away far inland. Dr. Mackinlay tells me that,
from the land-side, Oræfa appears a double-peaked broad
shouldered mountain; one of the peaks or ridges
presenting a deep scarped side like that of Salisbury
Crags.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>With but few interruptions, a chain of snow-mountains
stretches across the island, from Snæfells Jökul in the
west, to Thrandar Jökul in the east; while the central
desert or plain, running across from sea to sea between
this range and that on the south-east, is nearly 100
miles broad, from 2000 to 2200 feet above the sea level,
and only 400 or 500 feet from the snow-line. The
south-east corner of the island is an enormous unexplored
snow or ice plateau, called Klofa or Vatna Jökul,
of about 2400 square miles, chiefly covered with, or at
all events surrounded by ranges of jökuls, over which
Oræfa, the most southern jökul of this unexplored
region and the king of Iceland mountains, keeps watch
and ward.</p>

<p class='c011'>Away to the north-west, bounding this icy region on
the west, rises Skaptár Jökul, by far the most destructive
volcano in the island.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a> And “in no part of the
world,” remarks Dr. Lindsay, “are volcano phenomena
on so gigantic a scale as in Iceland. In it there are lava
streams fifty miles long, twelve to fifteen miles broad
and six hundred feet deep. Portions of these streams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>sometimes form hills as high as Arthur’s Seat or
Salisbury Crags; and such is the persistence of the heat,
that rents in the lava have been found still smoking, or
filled with hot water, so long as eleven years after an
eruption. In no part of the world of the same extent,
are there so many widely separate vents or foci—about
twenty—of subterranean igneous action. The boiling
springs which are most numerous, show of themselves
that such action is going on under the whole island.
The calculations of Professor Bischoff show, that the
mass of lava thrown up by the eruption of Skaptár Jökul,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1783, was greater in bulk than Mont Blanc. A
larger mass of lava by far, than was ever thrown out
from a single volcano, at any time, in any part of the
world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As a particular example of the ravages produced by
these terrible convulsions of nature may give the reader
a clearer and more vivid idea of their action, than any
general description, we shall select the</p>

<h3 id='ch5s3' class='c025'><span class='xlarge'>ERUPTION OF <a id='tn187'></a>SKAPTÁR JÖKUL,</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>in 1783; it having been not only very violent, but the
one of which we possess the fullest and most authentic
accounts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The preceding winter and the spring of that year
had been unusually mild, and nothing seemed to foretell
the approaching danger, till towards the end of May,
when a light bluish fog was seen floating along the
ground, succeeded in the beginning of June by earthquakes,
which daily increased in violence till the 8th of
that month. At nine in the morning of that day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>numerous pillars of smoke were noticed rising in the hill
country towards the north, which, gradually gathering
into a dark bank, obscured the atmosphere, and proceeding
in a southerly direction against the wind, involved
the whole district of Sida in darkness, showering down
sand and ashes to the thickness of an inch. This cloud
continued to increase till the 10th, when fire-spouts
were observed in the mountains, accompanied by earthquakes.
Next day the large river Skaptaá, which in the
spring had discharged a vast quantity of fetid water,
mixed with gravel or dust, and had lately been much
swollen, totally disappeared. This incident was fully
accounted for on the 12th, when a huge current of lava,
burst from one side of the volcano, and rushed with a
loud crashing noise down the channel of the river, which
it not only filled, but even overflowed, though in many
places from four to six hundred feet deep and two
hundred broad. The fiery stream after leaving the hills,
threatened to deluge the low country of Medalland,
when a lake that lay in its way intercepted it during
several days. But at length the incessant torrents filled
the basin, and proceeded in two streams, one to the
east, where its progress was for a short time interrupted
by the Skalarfiall, up which, however, the accumulating
flood soon forced its way, rolling the mossy covering over
the mountain before it like a large piece of cloth. The
other current directed its progress towards the south,
through the district of Medalland, passing over some old
tracts of lava, which again began to burn, whilst the air
in its cavities escaped with a strange whistling noise, or
suddenly expanding, threw up immense masses into the
air to the height of more than 120 feet. The waters of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the rivers, swollen by the melting of the Jökuls in the
interior, and intercepted in their course by the glowing
lava, were thrown into a state of violent ebullition, and
destroyed many spots spared by the fire. In this
district, the liquid matter continued to flow to the 20th
of July, following principally the course of the Skaptaá,
where it poured over the lofty cataract of Stapafoss,
filling up the enormous cavity the waters had been
hollowing out for ages. During the whole of this eruption,
the atmosphere was filled with mephitic vapours, or
darkened with clouds of ashes, by which the sun was
either concealed from the miserable inhabitants, or
appeared like a blood-red globe, adding to their terror
and consternation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The molten elements had so long confined their fury
to the Skaptaá, that the inhabitants of the eastern
district on the Hverfisfliot, though much incommoded
by the showers of ashes, hoped to escape its more
immediate visitations. But on the 28th of June, a cloud
of sand and smoke caused so thick a darkness, that in the
houses at noon, a sheet of white paper, held opposite the
window, could not be <a id='tn189a'></a>distinguished from the black walls,
whilst red-hot stones and dust burnt up the pastures,
poisoned the waters, and threatened to set fire to the
dwellings. On the 3d of August a thick vapour rising
from the Hverfisfliot, the entire disappearance of its
waters, and a foaming fire-stream, which on the 9th
rushed with indescribable fury down its bed, overflowing
the country in one night to the extent of more than four
miles, converted the fearful anticipations of the natives
into dreadful realities. The eruptions of sand, ashes,
pumice, and lava <a id='tn189b'></a>continued till the end of August, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the volcano appeared completely exhausted; but flames
were still seen in February, 1784, and thick clouds of
smoke, even in July of that year. The whole catastrophe
closed in August with an earthquake of such extreme
violence that men were thrown to the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The immediate source whence this enormous mass of
matter issued is entirely unknown, being situated in that
great central desert of sand and snow which none of the
natives have ever penetrated; and no traditions of any
former occurrence of this kind have been preserved.
Some persons who went up into the mountains during
the continuance of the eruption were, in consequence of
the thick smoke, compelled to return, and some subsequent
attempts met with no better success. It is not
even known whether the current that flowed from the
<a id='tn190'></a>Skaptaá and that in the Hverfisfliot proceeded from the
same crater; it is, however, probable their sources were
different though closely connected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The extent of the lava can only be accurately known
in the inhabited districts. The stream that flowed down
the Skaptaá is calculated at about fifty miles in length,
by twelve or fifteen at its greatest breadth: that in the
Hverfisfliot at forty miles in length by seven in breadth.
In the narrow channel of the Skaptaá it rose to 500 or
600 feet; but in the plains its extreme height does not
exceed 100, and in many places is only eight or ten feet.
From its immense thickness, it was a long time in cooling,
being so hot in July 1784, twelve months after the
eruption, that Mr. Stephenson could not cross it, and
even then sending up a thick smoke or steam. In the
year 1794 it still retained an elevated temperature,
emitting vapours from various places, and many of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>crevices being filled with warm water. This long retention
of heat will appear more extraordinary, when we
consider the numerous globular cavities and fissures it
contained, permitting a free circulation of the water and
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The destructive effects of this volcano were not confined
to its immediate vicinity, vast quantities of sand
and ashes being scattered over the remoter parts of the
country, and some were conveyed to the Faröe islands,
a distance of nearly 300 miles.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> The noxious vapours
that for many months infected the air were equally pernicious
to man and beast, and covered the whole island
with a dense fog which obscured the sun, and was perceptible
even in England and Holland. The steam rising
from the crater, or exhaled from the boiling waters,
was condensed in the cooler regions of the atmosphere,
and descended in floods that deluged the fields and consolidated
the ashes into a thick black crust. A fall of
snow in the middle of June, and frequent showers of
hailstones of unusual magnitude, accompanied with tremendous
thunder-storms, tearing up huge fragments of
rock, and rolling them down into the plains, completed
the scene of desolation. The grass and other plants
withered, and became so brittle that the weight of a
man’s foot reduced them to powder; and even where the
pastures seemed to have recovered, the cattle refused to
touch them, dying of actual starvation in the midst of
the most luxuriant herbage. Small unknown insects
covered many of the fields, while other portions of the
soil, formerly the most fertile, were changed by the ashes
into marshy wastes overgrown with moss and equiseta.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>A disease resembling scurvy in its most malignant type
attacked both men and cattle, occasioned in the former
no doubt by the want of food, and the miserable, often
disgusting, nature of that which alone they could obtain.
Many lived on the bodies of those animals which had
perished from hunger or disease, whilst others had recourse
to boiled skins, or substances still more nauseous
and unwholesome. The numerous earthquakes, with the
ashes and other matter thrown into the sea, caused the
fish to desert many parts of the coast; whilst the fishermen,
seldom daring to leave the land enveloped in thick
clouds during most of the summer, were thus deprived
of their usual stock of winter provisions. We cannot
better conclude this frightful catalogue of evils, than by
the following summary of the numbers of men and cattle
more or less immediately destroyed by it in two years.
The most moderate calculation makes these amount to
1300 human beings, 19,488 horses, 6,801 horned cattle,
and 129,937 sheep.” Stephenson makes these numbers
still higher and says, “9,336 men, 28,000 horses, 11,461
cattle, and 190,488 sheep.”<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Fine dust and vapour from this terrific eruption overspread
Asia, Europe, and America during the whole
summer. Franklin speculated on the cause of this haze,
and Dr. Mackinlay reminded me that Cowper, who
frequently refers to it in his letters, has, in the second
Book of the “Task,” a beautiful allusion to it, and also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>to the earthquake in Calabria which occurred nearly at
the same time as the Skaptár eruptions:</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1784, the year after the outbreak of Skaptár,
which left the whole island in mourning, was almost
as memorable for earthquakes, not only in Iceland,
but in many parts of the world widely separated from
each other, as 1755 had been in connection with the
eruption of Kötlugjá.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most of the Icelandic mountains are volcanic, and,
from the native history, we learn the frequency with
which they have manifested this character. Let us
glance at the following brief sketch of their</p>

<h3 id='ch5s4' class='c025'><span class='xlarge'>VOLCANIC HISTORY,</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>chiefly compiled by the author of “Iceland, Greenland,
and the Faröe Islands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of these mountains, this writer says, “most of them
seem now to be in the state of intermittent activity, in
which more or less violent paroxysms occur at intervals of
longer or shorter duration; and, but for the uncertainty
of these periods, we might consider some as in a state of
complete repose. These alternations of movement and
rest seem common to the separate members and to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>whole system; there being many years in which the
island remains undisturbed, whilst at other epochs it
appears as if entirely devoted to the fury of contending
elements. The most terrible of the volcanoes known in
ancient times were Hekla, Oræfa-Jökul, and the Kötlugjá;
to which have recently<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> been added Krabla,
Leirhnukr, and Skaptáfells, which commenced only in
the 18th century. The earliest record of such an occurrence
is that of <a id='tn194a'></a>Eldborg,<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> in the western part of the
island, said to have happened in the 9th or 10th century.
This was followed by the eruption from the mountains
in <a id='tn194b'></a>Guldbringu syssel in the year 1000, at the time when
the althing was deliberating as to the reception of the
Christian religion. In the 11th century Hekla appeared
in a state of violent commotion, which extending, in the
middle of the 12th, to many others, devastated the land
from north to south, and was accompanied by destructive
earthquakes. In the beginning and at a later
period of the 13th century, the south-western quarter
was particularly excited; whilst in the middle of the
succeeding one, the island was desolated by the most
terrible convulsions, concluding in 1391 with a violent
earthquake, felt over the whole country. From this date
till the beginning of the 16th, the volcanoes were comparatively
quiet; but at that period, and in the end of
the century, they raged both in the south and the
north. The 17th was again an interval of repose, in
which only the southern ones were active; but the
eighteenth age proved that their energies had undergone
no diminution, by eruptions even more violent than those
of the fourteenth. Between 1720 and 1730 the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>mountains were in incessant action, accompanied by
earthquakes; whilst in the north, Krabla and Leirhnukr
began their devastations. In the years 1753 and 1755
the <a id='tn195a'></a>Skeidará and Kötlugjá Jökuls poured out every
variety of volcanic matter. In 1766 Hekla again commenced,
and the destructive outbreak of the Skaptár in
1783 closed these frightful scenes. From that time till
1821, with the exception of some slight agitations, and
probably a few inconsiderable eruptions in the desert
part of the country, no displays of volcanic action
occurred.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Eyafialla Jökul continued in eruption from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1821
till 1822. In July 1823 it again began to burn. In
the same month Kötlugjá, covered nearly 100 miles of
ground with sand and ashes. “In July 1825, both sides
of the island were visited by earthquakes, accompanied
by destructive hurricanes and floods; whilst on the 13th
of February 1827, there was an eruption of the <a id='tn195b'></a>Skeidará
Jökul.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch6' class='c010'><span class='xxlarge'>THE EAST COAST. BREIDAMERKR—SEYDISFIORD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Sailing north-east along the coast, we see the Breidamerkr
ice-plains, and the mouth of the river Jökulsá,
which is only a mile or two long. Dr. Mackinlay informs
us that the most dangerous rivers in Iceland are the
shortest. They spring, full formed, from the bosom of
the thick-ribbed ice. The Jökulsá, which crosses <a id='tn197a'></a>Breidamerkr-sandr,
is one of the most dreaded of these. It
springs from <a id='tn197b'></a>Breidamerkr-Jökul, which, however, is not
a snow-mountain, but only a high field of ice projected
southward into the plain from the great snow-range to
the north. Some years it is eight or ten miles from the
sea, in others only one; the length of the river varies
accordingly. It is half a mile broad. Sometimes this
river gets dammed up, then bursts from caverns of ice
with a noise like thunder, carrying along with it masses
of ice with uncontrollable fury to the sea. Sunshine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>melting the ice swells such rivers more rapidly than
rain. The near view of this cold icy region—so dreary,
lone and still—made one almost feel cold, although the
sun was bright and the thermometer, at noon, stood at
100 degrees.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The dazzling whiteness of the snow and
the ice-blink, made our eyes ache. It was literally</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO HORNAFIORD.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>As we approach Hornafiord the character of the
mountains changes; instead of great white massive
ranges, many isolated, sharp-pointed, rugged peaks,
called horns, now rise. They are almost free from snow,
and of richly varied tints, chiefly lilacs and browns,
glowing in the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general character of the mountain-ranges at this
point, and indeed along the entrances to the fiords of the
east coast, as far as Seydisfiord, resembles Goatfell and
the Holy Island in Arran—firth of Clyde—only it is
higher, wilder, even more serrated, and, in addition, exhibits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>many curious fantastic pointed rocks or <i>drongs</i>.
Fleecy clouds often rested on the peaks, or rolled,
incense-like, among them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The western half of the island is diversified by a great
network of lakes, on whose lonely waters, Dr. Mackinlay
remarked, “thousands of milk white swans sport in the
summer sunshine,” while the eastern half is broken up
by isolated volcanoes whose smouldering fires are capped
with snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>The western coast is scooped out into two enormous
gulfs, the Faxa and <a id='tn199'></a>Breida fiords; while that portion of
the east coast, to which we have referred, viz.: from
Hornafiord to Seydisfiord, is all along closely indented
with little fiords or arms of the sea. These run inland
for a distance of from ten to eighteen miles, and average
say about two miles in breadth. They are separated from
each other by lofty mountain ridges, such as we have
described, running far out into the sea, and ending in
sheer precipitous headlands or lofty horns. Let the
reader lay his hand flat down on this page with his
fingers stretched apart, let him then suppose each of the
fingers to represent a mountain range, and the interspaces
fiords, and he will be able to form an idea of the
way in which the coast is indented. At Reydar and
Berufiords, these ridges appear to be about 2000 feet
high, with many sheer precipices, half that height, from
which a stone could be pitched into the sea. It will
thus be seen, that the fiords are shut in on both sides by
steep mountain ridges like walls of rock, the summits of
which are often veiled in dark clouds, and in some places
are covered with perpetual snow. These rocky heights are
as bare as if they had newly been splintered—not a tree or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>shrub on their sides—and the lone stillness of the fiords
is only broken by the wild “water lapping on the crag,”
the cataract roaring and leaping down rock gulleys, or
the streamlet trickling down the broad stair-like ledges
of the trap, dripping from step to step like a white
glassy fringe. These fiords appear to have been rents
formed when the island was first heaved up; and, where
the arm of the sea terminates, they are continued further
into the interior as green valleys down which rivers flow.
In places where mountain-tracks are utterly impracticable,
these river-courses serve for bridle-paths in passing
from one valley or fiord to another.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tender herbage affords delightful pasture for
sheep; fish, chiefly cod, are to be had in abundance in
the fiords, and the streams abound in trout. Vessels
can sail up and find sheltered havens in which to lie,
thus affording water carriage for the exchange of commodities,
and bringing the advantages of the coast to the
interior.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the country one never meets anything approaching
to a village. It is a populous district where you see a farm
in a valley, another group of turf hovels, called a <i>thorpe</i>,
a few miles further up, and perhaps, a homestead of some
kind perched on the green slope of a neighbouring hill-side.
Should there be, in addition to these, a black wood
building near the edge of the water, with a white
flagstaff before it—it is a merchant’s factory and gives to
the place the importance of a market-town.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now between 2 and 3 o’clock in the morning,
but as the sky was clear and lovely, and we were sailing
along a coast, the striking features of which, although
singularly picturesque, we had never seen described
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>in books, I remained on deck most of the night, and
only, from a forced sense of duty, lay down for a short
time without undressing.</p>

<p class='c011'>These fiords on the east coast are very similar in
character; most of the features we have noted being
common to them all. I shall therefore simply enumerate,
in their order, the names of those we passed between
Hornafiord and Seydisfiord, a distance of about 100
miles, for the first 75 of which the steamer’s course lay
north-east, and for the remaining 25 nearly due north:—Skardsfiord,
Papafiord, Lonfiord, Altafiord, Hamarsfiord,
Berufiord, Stödvarfiord, Faskrudsfiord, Reydarfiord,
Nordfiord, and Mjofifiord.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Saturday morning, between 5 and 6 o’clock, we
entered Seydisfiord, sailed up to the head of it and
dropped anchor, having now reached the extreme point
of our destination.</p>

<p class='c011'>This lonely fiord on the north-east of Iceland, is
land-locked like Lochgoil or Teignabraich in Scotland.
The valley at the head, with hills on either side, makes
a bend to the north, so that there are high hills all
round us. Those on the south—our left hand side—sweep
round, forming an amphitheatre, till they are
apparently met by those of the north-side; the fiord is
thus shut in on the west, and the continuation of the
valley, beyond it, shut out.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hill-sides are terraced with sixteen or eighteen
trap-steps, which run in regular horizontal layers and
yet further complete the resemblance of the head of the
fiord to a great amphitheatre. From these steps, water,
glassy-white, may be seen trickling down, every little
way, all round; with here and there a mountain cataract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>which has made a deep gully for itself. The hill-range
on the left, which sweeps round and bounds the view, is
capped with a series of singular rocky cones, occurring
at regular intervals, and in shape resembling the chimneys
of a glass work. They are mottled with snow-patches;
mist streaks float athwart them; while in the
west, not only those chimneys, but the top of the ridge
itself is now hid from view, muffled up in dense clouds
which form the curtain of the amphitheatre. A river
flows into the fiord from the valley, which, although
green and yielding a hay-crop, is marshy and much in
want of draining. From the sloping nature of the
ground, this could easily be done at little expense, and
would, we doubt not, prove a highly remunerative
investment.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>MR. HENDERSON’S FACTORY AT SEYDISFIORD.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Near the beach are three stores, or factories as they
are called; two belong to Danes, and the other to Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Henderson, one of the owners of the <i>Arcturus</i>, who has
been here for sometime but is going south with us to-night.
The factories are one-storey houses, built of wood.
A traffic in produce, chiefly fish and wool, is carried
on with the farmers, whose sod-covered dwellings are
sparsely scattered along the neighbouring coast, or in
valleys above the fiords. Customers are sometimes
attracted from much greater distances; we saw long
strings of ponies riding down water-courses, and crossing
the shoulders of bare hills where one would think there
was scarcely footing for a goat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before breakfast Dr. Mackinlay and I had a swim in
the fiord, and found the water much warmer than we
anticipated; indeed, it was pleasanter in this respect
than the last bath I had in the sea at Teignabraich.
We then breakfasted with Mr. Henderson, who gave us
a most cordial welcome. The steamer was several days
later in arriving than the time he had expected her, so
that he had almost begun to despair of her ever coming
for him, and was conjuring up gloomy visions of being
obliged to winter here, and fancying all sorts of things.
Now, for him, all was changed and bright. I tried to
masticate a bit of raw dried stock-fish, which the Icelanders
commonly use, eating it as we do bread. I also
tasted “snaps,” of which the Danes are so fond, for the
first and last time; it seemed like a mixture of gin and
kirchen-wasser, flavoured with coriander seed. The
breakfast before us was a most substantial one, there
being no lack either of welcome, which is the best of cheer,
or of mutton, fish, beer, coffee, milk, and stale black rye-bread.
Be it remembered that this breakfast was neither
Icelandic, Danish, nor Scotch; but, exhibiting some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>the characteristics of all three, seemed marvellously
adapted to our present requirements in this distant
habitat.</p>

<p class='c011'>We stepped into the store, and saw exposed for sale
hardware and soft goods of all kinds. In a corner were
standing lots of quart-bottles gaudily labelled “essence
of punch,” whatever that may be. Mr. Henderson
showed me some specimens of double refracting calc, or
Iceland spar, which is obtained in the neighbourhood.
It only occurs in one place of the island, filling a fissure
of greenstone from two to three feet wide and twenty to
twenty-five feet long, on the north bank of the Reydarfiord,
about a thousand feet above the sea level. There,
a cascade rushes over the rock, bringing down fragments
of the spar from time to time. The mass itself gets
loosened, bit by bit, through the action of frost on the
moisture which enters edgeways between the laminae,
wedging them apart in the direction of the cleavage of
the crystals. Transparent specimens more than a few
inches in size are rare and valuable. Mr. Henderson
presented me with a beautiful large semi-transparent
chalcedony weighing 1 ℔ 7 oz., and some pebbles.</p>

<p class='c011'>His partner, Mr. Jacobson, an Icelander, also gave me
a young raven to make a pet of. It was this year’s bird
and quite tame. I called it Odin; and, having got
hold of an old box, improvised a door from a few spars,
that it might have a sheltered place to roost in at night
till it got to the end of its voyage.</p>

<p class='c011'>I now wandered up the valley, for an hour or two, alone,
and sat down on a slope, on the right side of it, to look
around me and rest. The river, near where I sit, flashes
down over a steep rock and forms a fine waterfall, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>roaring of which is echoed from the chimney-capped
amphitheatre of hills opposite. Beneath the fall, it flows
peacefully along, runnelling and rippling on, to the blue
fiord, through the quiet green valley. White streamlets
of water trickle down the trap hill-sides, every forty or
fifty yards; the whole producing a continuous quiet
murmur or undertone, not unlike that from the wings
of an innumerable swarm of gnats playing in the sunshine
on a warm summer’s day, but ever broken in upon
by the clear liquid tinkle of the streamlets nearest us,
heard drip, dripping, with a clear metallic sound which
might be compared to the chirp of the grasshopper.
This solitary glen, now lying bathed in light, is fanned
by the gentle breeze, fragrant with the smell of tedded
hay, and richly variegated with wild flowers—harebells,
<a id='tn205'></a>butter-cups, wild thyme, cotton-grass, and forget-me-nots—a
gathered bunch of which is now lying beside me
on a moss-cushioned rock. Quietly musing here on all,
of strange or new, I have seen since leaving home, and
dwelling more particularly on the great kindness I have
received at all hands, I feel grateful to God, who has
hitherto opened up a way for me and given me friends
amongst strangers wherever I chanced to wander.</p>

<p class='c011'>We saw specimens of surturbrand, which crops out on
the top of a steep mountain, at the mouth of the fiord,
on the north side, and obtained a few more geological
specimens and plants.</p>

<p class='c011'>After dinner, I strolled for a quarter of a mile up the
valley with Mr. Henderson and Dr. Mackinlay, to visit
the farm behind the store. It consists of a group of
hovels, the walls are stone and turf, the gables wood,
and the roofs covered with green sod. The entrance is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>dark muddy passage leading into a ground-floor apartment
as dark and muddy, where, in winter, cattle are
kept. The kitchen is a dirty, smoky, sooty hole, with
fish hanging in it to smoke and dry; a pot of seal-blubber
stands steaming in a corner. The fire is raised
on a few stones above the floor, like a smithy-forge;
while there is a hole in the roof for the smoke. Picking
our way through another long passage, dark and dirty,
we found a trap-ladder and ascended to a little garret,
where I could only walk erect in the very centre.
The apartment was floored and fitted up with bunks all
round the sides and ends. In these box-beds, at least
seven people—men, women and children—sleep at night,
and sometimes a few more have to be accommodated.
The little windows in the roof are not made to open, and
no regard whatever is paid to ventilation. Dr. Mackinlay
prescribed for an old man we found lying ill in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>abominable fetid atmosphere, where his chances of recovery
were very slight. He was an old farm servant
about whom nobody seemed to care anything.</p>

<p><span class='small'>FARM HOUSE, SEYDISFIORD.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In a little apartment shut off from this one, and in
the gable portion of the building which in this case
constitutes the front of the house, an old woman at the
window sits spinning with the ancient distaff,<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> precisely
as in the days of Homer.</p>

<p class='c011'>To amuse the farmer’s daughters I showed them my
sketches, with which they seemed much interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>I understood part of their remarks, and could in some
degree make myself understood by them, with the few
Danish and Icelandic words I kept picking up. On
receiving a little money and a few knick-knacks, they,
all round, held out their hands and shook mine very
heartily. This, the Icelanders always do, on receiving a
present of anything however trifling.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>After sketching the farm-house, I took two views of
Mr. Henderson’s store; one of them from a height
behind, looking down towards the fiord, and the other
from the brink of it, looking up the valley. In the latter,
a part of the same farm-house appears, and thus indicates
its exact position.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> With the assistance of these three

<p class='c021'>We sailed from Seydisfiord at half-past six <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on
Saturday night, direct for the Faröe islands.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a singular cone-shaped mountain called
Brimnæs Fjall at the mouth of the fiord, showing masses
of clay-rock alternating with and pushing up trap,
which is deposited in thin layers of perpendicular structure.
Several pillars or shafts are left standing singly
on the very summit, and present a very curious appearance,
distinctly relieved against the amber light of the
sky. At Dr. Mackinlay’s request I made a sketch of it.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A vessel of Mr. Henderson’s, which had been given up
as lost, now unexpectedly came in sight, which necessitated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Mr. Jacobson and a young Iceland lad, who were
<i>en route</i> to Copenhagen, to get on board her and return
to Seydisfiord to look after her cargo, evidently much to
their disappointment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wild scenery of the coast, especially at Reydarfiord,
was strikingly picturesque.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Murray, Professor Chadbourne, Mr. Henderson
and I walked the deck till a late or rather an early
hour, and watched the fast receding mountain-ranges of
Iceland—pale lilac, mauve, or deep purple—and the
distant horns, shading through <a id='tn209'></a>similar tints from rose
to indigo, all distinctly seen athwart the golden light
of the horizon which for hours has been ebbing slowly
and softly away, but is now on the turn, and about to
flow again.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Sabbath, August 7.</i> The weather is fine; no land or
sail in sight all day; whales playing about the ship.
Had many pleasant deck-walks and talks, and several
quiet hours, sitting perched on the stem, reading, or
watching the prow, below, cutting and cleaving through
the clear green water like a knife.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Monday morning, August 8.</i> We are sailing between
two of the Faröe islands, bright sunshine lighting
up all the regularly terraced trap-rocks, caves, and crevices
of this singular group.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have now got a pet to look after, and, without
Shakspere’s authority for it, we know that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Young ravens must have food.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The last thing I did last night was to shut <i>Odin</i> in his
box, and the first thing this morning to let him out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>again and give him the freedom of the ship. The bird
knows me, is pleased when I scratch his head, and confidingly
runs hopping to me for protection when the
boys about the ship teaze him more than he likes. His
fellow traveller, a young Icelandic fox brought on board
at Reykjavik to be sent to the Marquis of Stafford, also
runs about the ship during the day. At first we had
some misgivings on the subject; for</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Treason is but trusted like the fox—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who ne’er so tame, so cherished, and locked up,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>However, these fears were soon dissipated; for <i>Odin</i> can
hold his own, and when the fox, approaching furtively,
uses any liberty with his tail feathers, he suddenly gets
a peck from the bird’s great formidable beak, which he
does not seem much to relish. The salutary fear continues
for a short time, is forgotten, and again the dab
comes as a reminder. We were often greatly amused,
watching their individual habits and droll ways, when
the one intruded upon the other. It was half play, half
earnest, a sort of armed neutrality with a basis of mutual
respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the west coast of Stromoe is the roofless ruin of
the church of Kirkuboe. It was begun in the twelfth
century, but never finished. It is built of stone, has five
large windows and several small ones below; a little
farm house or hut, with red tiles on the roof, stands near
it. What a strange lonely place for a church! Thorshavn
lies on the other—the east—side of the island. It
is only five miles distant as the crow flies, but as we
have to sail round the south point, and Stromoe is
twenty-seven miles long, we do not reach it till near noon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>On landing, Mr. Haycock accompanied me to call for
Miss Löbner, who has been poorly ever since her sea
voyage. Her mother presented wine, cake, coffee &#38;c.,
and was most hospitable. None of us being able to
speak Faröese, at first we felt a little awkward; but a
brother of the old lady’s who speaks English soon came
to the rescue and acted as interpreter. With justifiable
pride, they again showed us their flower and kitchen
garden. I got the whale-knives, caps, shoes, gloves &#38;c.,
which had been made or procured for me during my
absence in Iceland. Ere leaving, Miss Löbner appeared
to say adieu! and insisted on my accepting several other
specimens of Faröese workmanship as remembrances of
Thorshavn. No people could have been kinder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, wandering about, we explored the town, looked
at the church, stepped into the stores, passed the
governor’s garden, and wandered a mile or two in that
direction in order to obtain a view, and get quit of the
fishy smells which superabound in Thorshavn.</p>

<p class='c011'>On our return we called for Mr. Müller, who presented
me with a copy of the gospel of St. Matthew in Danish
and Faröese, arranged in parallel columns. I understood
him to say that this was the only book ever printed in
the Faröese dialect, and that it is now out of print and
very rare. It bears the date of 1823.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here we saw an old man 76 years of age, an Icelander
who has been in Faröe for the last 40 years. He had
spent several years in England, and told me that, in
1815, he saw our regiments land at Liverpool after the
battle of Waterloo. He speaks English fluently.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Thames fishing smack, and a sloop from Lerwick,
are lying in the bay. Piping and dancing goes merrily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>on, on board the latter, relieved by intervals of music
alone. In one of these, we heard “The Yellow Hair’d
Laddie,” rendered with considerable taste, although,
doubtless, several “improvements and additions” were
made on the original score.</p>

<p class='c011'>We took some Faröese boatmen into the saloon of the
steamer, and I shall not soon forget the look of wonder
and utter astonishment pourtrayed on their countenances,
as they gazed on the mirrors and everything around, or
were shown things with which they were not familiar
and heard their uses explained. They were greatly
pleased with my life-belt. Dr. Mackinlay showed them
a multiplying-glass, and, as it was handed from one to
another—each man first making the discovery of what
had so inexplicably excited the wonder of the last
looker—the queer exclamations of amazement accompanied
by inimitable pantomimic gestures reached their
culminating point, and were irresistibly droll.</p>

<p class='c011'>The weather is all we could desire. The sailors are
singing some curious Danish songs, with the time well

<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>past 6 o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we are steaming out of the bay. The
evening is lovely, and the Thermometer, on the deck,
stands at 68°. Thorshavn soon disappears, and we leave
the Faröe islands astern, relieved against an amber sky,
Dimon being the most striking and conspicuous of the

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Tuesday, August 9.</i> At breakfast, tasted a whale-steak
which Miss Löbner had yesterday sent on board
for me, with particular instructions to the stewardess to
have it properly cooked. The flesh looked and tasted
like dry tough beef, with a slight flavour of venison.
The blubber, however was too strong for any of us to do
more than merely satisfy—not gratify—our curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day was lovely. Professor Chadbourne invited
me to visit and spend a month with him during his
holiday. Indeed, cordial, pressing invitations, all round,
were the order of the day. As fellow-travellers we had
been happy together, and felt sorry at the near prospect
of our little party being broken up and scattered; for
several valued friendships had been formed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between three and four o’clock in the afternoon, the
thermometer indicated 98° in the sun and 75° in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>shade. Dr. Mackinlay showed me an old Danish dollar
he had got, in change, at Reykjavik; it bore the date of
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1619, the year of the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers
from the <i>May Flower</i>. Part of the day was spent in
writing out these pages from my diary. In the evening
we saw, far to our left, faint and dim on the horizon
line, the north-west islands of Shetland; and by a quarter
to 8 o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> were sailing twenty miles to the west
of Fair Isle, which lies between Orkney and Shetland.
Both groups are in sight. We have not seen a sail since
we left Faröe, and now, what we at first fancied to be one,
off the north end of the Orkneys, turns out to be a light-house,
rising apparently from the sea, but in reality from
low lying land which is yet below the horizon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sunset to-night is gorgeous; cavernous recesses
opening through a dense purple cloud-bank into glowing
regions of fire; while broad flashing gleams ray out on
every side athwart the sky, as if from furnace-mouths.
Then we have moonlight on a sea smooth as glass, and
not even a ripple to be seen. The Orkney light-house,
now gleaming like a setting star, is left far astern. The
phosphoresence along the vessel’s side and in her wake
is most brilliant; while, seething, electric-like, from the
screw, it rivals the “churned fire-froth” of the demon
steed. The moon, half-hid, is at times deep crimson and
again bright yellow. Many falling stars are shooting
“madly from their spheres;” not that our music lured
them, although, “on such a night” of nights, when all is
harmonious, we cannot but sing. Mr. Murray gives us
“Home, sweet home” and “The last rose of summer,”
and ere retiring at midnight, all of us join together in
singing the “Spanish Chant.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span><i>Wednesday morning, August 10.</i> We are off Inverness;
wind a-head and rising. Professor Chadbourne
to-day gave me an oak-leaf which he plucked from the
tree, at Upsala, planted by Linnæus with his own hands.
Wrote as long as the heaving of the ship would admit of
it, then arranged botanical specimens and read Wordsworth.
The wind is blowing so fresh, off Peterhead, that,
with full steam, we are not making above one and a half
knots; and at times can scarcely keep any way on.
Passed the Bell-Rock; the sea still rising. Went to bed
at 11 o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>; vessel pitching a good deal.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Thursday morning, August 11.</i> Rose at four o’clock
and was on deck ere the <i>Arcturus</i> dropt anchor in
Leith Roads. But as we cannot get our traps on shore
till the custom-house officer comes at nine o’clock to
overhaul them, we remain and breakfast on board<a id='tn215'></a>. The
examination made, at half-past ten o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, we landed
by a tug steamer, and made for our respective railway
stations, each, on parting, bidding the other “a bright
adieu!” in the hope that it might only be for “a brief
absence!” “Odin” was in good feather: his owner sun-bronzed
and strong.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, comfortably ensconsed in the fast express, I
lay back in the corner of a compartment, closed my eyes
and resigned myself to see pleasant pictures and dream
waking dreams—of snow jökuls, volcanoes, glaciers, and
ice-fields; of geysers, mud-cauldrons, and sulphur-pits;
of lava plains, black, wierd and blasted, or dreary wastes
of ice; of deep rapid rivers, flashing waterfalls, leaping
torrents; of frightful chasms, rugged cliffs, and precipitous
mountains mirrored in deep blue fiords; of pathless
stony deserts, enlivened at times with oasis-like spots of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>tender green herbage and bright coloured flowers; of
wild break-neck rides, over bare rocks, among slabs and
lava-blocks of all shapes and sizes and lying in every
conceivable direction; through volcanic sands and scoriæ;
by red and black vetrified craters, or across dangerous
fords; of multifarious scamperings too, and mud-plashings
over hill and dale; or wild rides down rocky steeps,
not on a phantom steed, but on a sure-footed Iceland
pony; of pleasant companionship by the way; of cordial
welcome and great kindness received, in quiet homesteads,
and at all hands from the people, wherever we
went; then again of Frost contending with Fire, and of
all the varied and marvellous phenomena of Iceland,
that singularly interesting island in the lone North
Sea.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s1u1' class='c034'><span class='large'>I. THE DARK SCHOOL.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>Long, long ago, when Trolls and Giants lived among
men, there was a famous school where curious youths
were taught the mysteries of witchcraft. France and
Germany both claim the honour of it, but no one knows
where it really was.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was kept in a dismal cavern, deep underground,
into which no ray of sunlight ever entered. Here, the
scholars had to stay no less than seven winters; for it
took them all that time to complete their studies. They
never saw their teacher from one year’s end to another.
Every morning a grey grizzly hand, all covered with hair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>pushed itself through the cavern wall and gave to each
one his lesson book. These books were written all over
with letters of fire, and could be read with ease, even in
the dark. The lessons over, the same grizzly hand
again appeared to take away the books and bring in the
scholars’ dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the close of winter, the scholars who had then got
through their seven years apprenticeship were dismissed.
The great iron door was opened, and the master stood
watching those who went out; for he had stipulated that
the scholar who walked hindmost, in passing through,
was to be seized by him and kept as a thrall. But who
was this strange school-master? Why, Old Nick himself.
No wonder, then, that each of the scholars struggled
hard to be first in passing the fatal threshold.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once on a time, there were three Icelanders at the
dark school; Sæmund Frodi, afterwards parish priest at
Oddi, <a id='tn220'></a>Kalfur Arnason, and Halfdan Eldjarnsson, afterwards
parish priest at Fell, in Slettuhlid. They were
all dismissed at the same time. Sæmund, to the great
delight of his companions, offered to walk hindmost in
going out of school, so he dressed himself in a long
loose cloak, which he took care to leave unbuttoned, and
bidding good bye to school-fellows left behind, prepared
to follow his countrymen. Just as he was putting his
feet on the first step of the stair which led up from the
school door, Old Nick, who was watching hard by, made
a clutch at the cloak and called out,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sæmund Frodi, pass not the door,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art my thrall for evermore.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And now the great iron door began to turn on its hinges;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>but, before Old Nick had time to slam it too, Sæmund
slipt his arms out of the sleeves of his cloak, and sprung
forward out of the grasp of his enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>In doing so, the door struck him a heavy blow on the
heel, which gave him a good deal of pain, when he said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The door hath swung too near the heel,</div>
      <div class='line'>But better sore foot than serve the Deil.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And so Sæmund outwitted Old Nick, and got away
from the dark school along with his two friends. Since
then, it has become a common saying in Iceland, when
a person has had a narrow escape from danger, that “the
door swung too near his heels.”<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<h5 id='ap1s1u2' class='c034'><span class='large'>II. <a id='tn221b'></a>SÆMUND GETS THE LIVING OF ODDI.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>At the time Sæmund, Kalfur, and Halfdan came out
of the dark school, there was no priest at Oddi, for the
old priest had just died. All three of them would fain
have the living, and so each went to the king to ask it
for himself. The king knew his men; and so he sent
them all away with the same answer, that whoever
reached Oddi first, should be made priest of that place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thereupon Sæmund summoned Old Nick and said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>him, “Now, I’ll make a bargain with you, if you swim
with me on your back across to Iceland, and land me
there without wetting my coat-tail, I’ll be your servant
as long as I live.” Old Nick was highly pleased with
the offer and agreed at once. So, in less than no time,
he changed himself into a seal, and left Norway with
Sæmund on his back.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sæmund took care to have his prayer book with him,
and read bits out of it every now and then while on the
way. As soon as they got close to the shores of Iceland,
which they did in less time than you would think, he
closed the book and suddenly struck the seal such a
heavy blow on the neck with it that the animal went
down all at once into deep water. Sæmund, now left
to himself, struck out for the shore and got easily to
land. In this way Old Nick lost his bargain, and
Sæmund got the living of Oddi.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s1u3' class='c034'><span class='large'>III. THE GOBLIN AND THE COWHERD.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>When Sæmund was priest of Oddi, he once had a
cowherd—a good servant withal, but greatly addicted to
swearing. Sæmund often reproved him for this, but all
his reproofs were of no avail. At last he told him, he
really ought to leave off his bad habits, for Old Nick
and his servants lived upon people’s curses and wicked
words. “Say you so?” said the cowherd, “if I knew for
certain that Old Nick would lose his meals by it, I would
never say a bad word more.” So he made up his mind
to mend his ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll soon see whether you are in earnest or not,” said
Sæmund, and so, he forthwith lodged a goblin in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>cowhouse. The cowherd did not like his guest, and no
wonder: for he was up to every kind of mischief, and
almost worried the life out of him with his wicked
pranks. The poor cowherd bore up bravely for a time,
and never let slip an oath or angry word. The goblin
got leaner day by day, to the intense delight of the cowherd,
who hoped, bye and bye, to see an end of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>One morning, on opening the byre door, the poor cowherd
found every thing turned topsy-turvy. The milk
pails and stools were broken in pieces and scattered
about the floor; and the whole of the cows—and there
were many of them—tied tail to tail, were straggling
about without halters, and goring each other. It needed
but half an eye to see who had done the mischief. So
the cowherd in a rage turned round to the goblin who,
shrunk and haggard, lay crouched up in a corner of a
stall, the very picture of wretchedness, and poured forth
such a volley of furious curses as would have overwhelmed
any human being in the same plight. The goblin all at
once began to revive; his skin no longer shrivelled
looked smooth and plump; his eye brightened up, and
the stream of life again flowed joyously through his veins.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O, oh!” said the cowherd, as he suddenly checked
himself, when he saw the wonderful effect his swearing
had on the goblin, “Now I know for certain that Sæmund
was right.” And from that day forward he was
never known to utter an oath. As for the goblin, he
soon pined away again and has long since been beyond
troubling anybody. May you and I, and all who hear
this story, strive to follow the good example of Sæmund’s
cowherd!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>
  <h5 id='ap1s1u4' class='c034'><span class='large'>IV. OLD NICK MADE HIMSELF AS LITTLE AS HE WAS ABLE.</span></h5>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Sæmund one day asked Old Nick how little he could
make himself. “Why,” replied he, “as for that I could
make myself as small as the smallest midge.” Thereupon
Sæmund bored a tiny hole in the door post, and
asked him to make good his boast by walking into it.
This he at once did; but no sooner was he in, than Sæmund
stopped the hole with a little plug of wood, and
made all fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Nick cursed his folly, cried, and begged for mercy;
but Sæmund would not take out the stopper till he
promised to become his servant and do all that he was
told. This was the reason why Sæmund always had it
in his power to employ Old Nick in whatever business
he liked.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s1u5' class='c034'><span class='large'>V. THE FLY.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>As might be expected, Old Nick always harboured
a great ill will against Sæmund: for he could not help
feeling how much he was in Sæmund’s power. He
therefore tried to revenge himself on various occasions;
but all his tricks failed, for Sæmund was too sharp for
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once, he put on the shape of a little fly, and hid himself—so
he thought, at least—under the film that had
gathered on the priest’s milk jug, hoping that Sæmund
would swallow him unawares, and so lose his life. But
Sæmund had all his eyes about him; so instead of
swallowing the fly he wrapped it up in the film, covered
the whole with a bladder, and laid the package on the
altar. There, the fly was obliged to remain till after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>service, when Sæmund opened the package and gave Old
Nick his liberty. It is told, as a truth, that old Nick
never found himself in a worse case than when lying on
the altar before Sæmund.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s1u6' class='c034'><span class='large'>VI. THE GOBLIN’S WHISTLE.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>Sæmund had a whistle of such wonderful power, that,
as often as he blew it, one or more goblins appeared before
him, ready to do his bidding.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a> One day, on getting
up, he happened to leave the whistle under his pillow,
and forgot all about it till the afternoon when the housemaid
was going to make his bed. He charged her, if
she found anything unusual about the bed, she was on no
account to touch it, or move it from its place. But he
might have saved himself the trouble of speaking; for,
as soon as the girl saw the whistle, she took it up in her
hand, and looked at it on every side. Not satisfied with
much handling it, she put it to her mouth and blew it
lustily. The sound of the blast had not died away before
a goblin stood before her, saying, “what will you have
me to do?” The girl was not a little startled, but had
the presence of mind to conceal her surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>It so happened that the hides of ten sheep, that had
been killed that day, were lying on the ground in front
of the parsonage. Recollecting this, the girl replied to
the goblin, “Go and count all the hairs that are on the
ten hides outside, and, if you finish your task before I
get this bed made, I’ll consent to marry you.” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>goblin thought that a task worth undertaking for such a
prize; and hurrying out, fell to counting the hairs with
all his might. The girl who did not like the idea of
being the wife of a goblin, lost no time, you may be sure,
in getting through with her work; and it was well she
bestirred herself; for, by the time the bed was made, the
goblin had almost finished his task. Only a few hairs
of the last hide remained uncounted, but they were
enough to make him lose his bargain. When Sæmund
afterwards learned how prudently the girl had got out of
her scrape, he was very well pleased.</p>

<h4 id='ap1s2' class='c034'><span class='xlarge'>ICELANDIC FAIRY TALES.</span></h4>

<h5 id='ap1s2u1' class='c034'><span class='large'>BIARNI SVEINSSON AND HIS SISTER SALVÖR.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a></span></h5>

<p class='c021'>Once on a time, a worthy couple, Sveinn and his wife,
occupied a farm, on the shores of the beautiful Skagafiord,
in the north country. They were in easy
circumstances and were blessed with two fine children, a
son and daughter, who were the joy of their hearts.
Biarni and his sister Salvör—for these were the names
of their children—were twins and greatly attached to
each other.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>In the spring of the year,<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a> about St. John’s day, when
these two had reached the age of twenty, the people of
Skagafiord were arranging a party to make a journey to
the mountains of the interior, to gather Iceland-moss for
making porridge. Sveinn promised to let his son go with
the party. As soon as Salvör knew that, she felt a
great desire to go too; and so she went to her parents to
ask their consent. This was not so easily got, as they
did not wish to part with both their children at once;
and besides, they knew she was ill fitted to bear the
hardships and fatigues of mountain travelling. But she
fretted so much at the thought of being left behind, that,
at last, they consented to let her go.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night before the moss-gatherers were to leave,
Sveinn the farmer dreamed that he had two beautiful
white birds, of which he was very fond, and that all at
once, to his great grief, the hen-bird disappeared and
could nowhere be found. On awaking in the morning,
he could not help thinking that his dream betokened no
good to his darling Salvör, so he called her to him, and
after telling her his dream, he said to her, “Salvör dear!
I cannot bear to part with you, you must stay at home
with your mother and me, for I would never forgive
myself if any ill befel you by the way.” Salvör who
had been in great glee at the prospect of riding, day
after day, up the romantic valleys to the south of
Skagafiord, and there tenting out amidst the mountains,
was neither to hold nor to bind, when she found that,
after all, she would have to stay at home; she wept with
vexation and distressed herself so much that her father
could not bear it, and again gave an unwilling consent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>to let her go. So she accompanied her brother and the
rest of the party to the mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first day after getting there, she gathered <a id='tn228a'></a>Iceland-moss
with the others, but during the night she fell
suddenly ill and was unable to leave her tent on the
following day. Biarni stayed with her, and did all that
a brother could do to help and comfort her. For three
whole days he was her companion, but, on the fourth
day, he left her for a time in charge of a friend, while he
himself joined the moss-gatherers. After partly filling
his bag, he sat himself down by a large stone, and,
resting his head on his hand, brooded over his sister’s
unhappy fate; he feared she was going to die among
the mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>By and by he heard a great tramping of horses, and,
on looking about, he saw two men riding towards him
at a quick pace. One of them wore red coloured
clothes, and had a red horse; the other who was younger,
was dressed in black, and was mounted on a black horse.
On reaching the place where Biarni was sitting, they
dismounted and saluted him by name.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What ails you Biarni,” said the elder of the two
strangers. For a time Biarni answered not a word, but
on being pressed to do so, he opened up his heart to
them and told all about his sister’s illness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My companions are going to return home, but I
must stay to watch over Salvör; and who knows how
soon she may die in my arms.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are in a hard case Biarni,” said the other, “and
I am sorry for you, but <a id='tn228b'></a>won’t you leave your sister with
me, and I will take good care of her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no,” said Biarni, “that I dare not do, for I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>neither who you are, nor where you come from. But
will you tell me where your home is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s no business of yours,” said the other, rather
gruffly, and then, taking from his pocket a silver-gilt box
set with precious stones, added, “Won’t you sell me your
sister for this box.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Biarni, “nor for a thousand like it. I
would not give her to you for any money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! well! there is no help for it, you will at all
events accept this box, as a token that you have met
with men among the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Biarni took the offered gift with pleasure, and thanked
the giver. The two men then bade him farewell and
rode away, while he returned to the tent. Next
morning his companions went away home, leaving him
alone with his sister. Though she was now a little
better, he dared not sleep, for he was afraid lest the
strangers should come and steal her away. But, after
watching a whole day and night, he felt overcome with
fatigue; so he lay down, and folding his arms round her
waist to protect her, fell into a sound sleep. But, when
he awoke, his sister was gone, and was nowhere to be
found. He spent a whole day sorrowfully wandering
from spot to spot, looking and calling for her, but it was
all in vain. He then turned his back on the mountains,
and with a heavy heart went home, and told his parents
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Woe is me,” said Sveinn, “what I feared most has
come to pass, but God’s will be done!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was great grief in <a id='tn229'></a>Skagafiord when the news
spread from farm to farm; for Salvör, with all her way-wardness,
was a promising girl, and was every body’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>favourite. A party of young men returned to the mountains
to look for her, but nowhere was the least trace of
her to be found.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now ten years had passed away. By this time
Biarni was married and settled on a farm, not far from
his father’s. During autumn all his sheep went amissing,
and his shepherd could not discover what had become of
them though he searched diligently for them three whole
days. On learning this, Biarni bid his wife provide him
with a week’s supply of food, and an extra pair of shoes;
“for,” said he, “I shall go to the mountains myself to
look for the sheep.” His parents, who were still alive,
urged him to stay at home; for they feared that, if he
went to the mountains, they might never see his face
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must go,” said he to them, “I cannot afford to lose
the sheep. But be of good heart, and do not begin to
weary for me till the week is over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He then went away on foot, and did not leave off
walking for three days. At the end of that time he
came to a cavern, where he turned in and lay down to
sleep. On waking, he could not see a yard before him;
for a thick fog which rested on the ground. He continued
his journey, but soon lost his way. Towards
evening the fog cleared off, and he found himself in a
spacious valley, not far from a large well built farm
house. It was the hay season, so that all the people of
the farm were busy in the meadow. On getting near the
house, he noticed, in particular, two women and a girl
who were tedding the hay. “God’s peace be with you,”
said he, on reaching the spot; and then, telling them
of his mishaps, he asked permission to stay all night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>under their roof. They gave him a hearty welcome, and
the girl went with him to the house. She was of more
genteel appearance than the rest—young and handsome—and,
as Biarni thought, bore some resemblance to his
long lost but well remembered sister. This unexpected
circumstance renewed his old griefs, but he did what he
could to seem cheerful before his young hostess. She
led him through several apartments to a large well
furnished room, where everything was neat and tidy.
Here, she drew in a chair, and kindly asked him to sit
down and rest, while she brought in supper. He had
not long to wait; for she soon placed upon the table a
plentiful supply of meat and wine.</p>

<p class='c011'>After supper, she showed him to the little room where
he was to sleep for the night; she then took away his
wet clothes, wished him a kind good night, and left the
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Biarni lay in bed, he fell a-wondering where he
was, and how the sight of the girl should have so waked
up the sad memories of the past. He fell asleep thinking
of these things, but was soon awakened by the sound
of singing in a room over his head. It was the family
at evening worship, as is the custom of the country. He
heard both men and women singing, but one voice
sounded clear above all others, and thrilled to his very
heart, so strongly did it remind him of his sister Salvör.
Thoughts of the past filled his mind and kept him awake
for hours, but he fell asleep again, and slept on, till he
was roused up in the morning by the girl. She brought
with her a suit of fine clothes, and bade him put them on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-day is Sunday,” she added, “and you must stay
here till to-morrow.” She then left the room.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>While Biarni was putting on his clothes, a little boy
in a green coat, and very nicely dressed, came into the
room and wished him good morning. “What has
brought you here, so far away from home?” said the
little fellow to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have come to look for some sheep that I have
lost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I have not seen them in this valley. But I
hope you <a id='tn232'></a>won’t go to look for them to-day. Father is
going to hear service in the church, and you must be
there too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before Biarni had time to reply, some one called the
boy away, saying, “Sveinn, come here, and don’t plague
the stranger with your nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At breakfast, Biarni was waited on by the girl who
had treated him so well the evening before.</p>

<p class='c011'>Towards mid-day, people began to come from far and
near, to join in the public service in the church close by.
The boy came for Biarni, and led him by the hand into
the church and showed him to a seat. On looking
about, what was his surprise to see by his side the man
in the red clothes whom he had seen, ten years before,
among the mountains! But, his surprise was greater
still, on discovering that the clergyman who conducted
the service, was no other than the man in the black
dress who had travelled with the other. The church
was full of people. Most of the men were tall and
strongly built, but had something forbidding about their
looks. Some wore brown knitted garments of undyed
wool. Biarni said nothing to his neighbour, but took
out the gilt box and offered him a pinch of snuff. This
he took, but without seeming to recognize Biarni.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>By and by, Biarni saw, seated just in front of the
pulpit, a comely well dressed woman who seemed the
very picture of his sister. When their eyes met, she was
overcome with emotion and began to smile and weep by
turns. Biarni now felt confident that it was indeed his
beloved sister Salvör whom he now saw before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The service decently performed to the end and the
blessing pronounced, the boy again took Biarni by the
hand and led him out. In passing the church door, an
old ill looking man, who sat there, tripped Biarni up and
made him fall. On this, the man in the red clothes
came forward and chastised the offender, while Biarni
went with the boy into the farm house. The two men
whom Biarni had met among the mountains, shortly
after came in and saluted him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know us, Biarni!” said they to him kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” replied he. But not another word could he
utter for emotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment after, the woman, he had seen in the
church and taken for his sister, entered the room. She
flew into his arms and pressed him to her bosom saying,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before we were born we lay in each other’s arms, I
was taken weeping from thy embrace, and now I return
laughing to thy arms, my brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a joyful meeting.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Biarni recovered himself, he told his sister
about his parents, and also all that had happened in
Skagafiord since her departure. The man in red clothes
then addressed himself to Biarni, and said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whilst thou wert asleep among the mountains, I
took thy sister away from thee and gave her in marriage
to this man in the black dress, who is my son. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>is the clergyman of the valley and I am the sysselman.
It was I that took away the sheep and led thee astray to
this place, that brother and sister might meet again.
To-night thou must stay here with thy sister. To-morrow
I shall give thee back thy lost sheep and go with thee
part of the way to Skagafiord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Biarni spent a happy evening with Salvör. In the
morning he took leave of her with many tears, and departed
under the guidance of her husband and of her
father-in-law, who gave him back his sheep, and helped
him to drive them. On reaching the inhabited part
of the country, his new friends parted with him and
bade him an affectionate farewell; but not before they
had made him promise to leave <a id='tn234a'></a>Skagafiord and live
with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must come and settle in the valley beside us,”
said they to him, “we shall return next summer and
lead you and your friends to your sister’s home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On getting to <a id='tn234b'></a>Skagafiord, Biarni told his wife and
mother all that had happened to him, when away, and
also the promise he had made to remove to the
mountains; but charged them to say nothing to the
neighbours about it. His parents were rejoiced to
learn that Salvör was still alive, and promised to go with
him and his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>In June of the next year, three men, from the
mountains, rode up one night to Biarni’s house. The
night following, Biarni, and his parents, and all his
household went away with them and in due time reached
the valley where Salvör lived. How it rejoiced Sveinn
and his wife to see again their long lost daughter! They
settled in the valley and died there, at a good old age.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Biarni lived there too, for many years, but he could
never forget the beautiful <a id='tn235'></a>Skagafiord; so when age came
upon him, he returned to his old home, and spent his
latter years among the friends of his youth.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s2u2' class='c034'><span class='large'>UNA THE FAIRY.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>Many many years ago, a strapping young fellow, called
Geir, was settled in the farm of Randafell, on the south
slope of the Eyafialla mountains, near the sea-coast.
Every thing prospered with him; for he was active and
industrious, and scorned to eat the bread of idleness.
His wife was as industrious as himself, but unfortunately,
she took ill and died, shortly after their marriage. At
the hay-making season, which came on soon after, he
missed his wife greatly; for the maid servants were too
few to look after the house and make the hay.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day, when they had a good deal more work before
them than they were able to get through, a strange woman
made her appearance in the hay field, and, without
so much as saying, “by your leave,” began at once to
handle the rake; and cleverly she handled it, too, for she
got through more work than any two of them. She was
young and handsome, but silent as the grave. Not a
word could Geir, or any one else, get out of her the live
long day. At night she disappeared, no one knew
where; but, when morning came, there was she, first in
the field, ready to take her place among the women.</p>

<p class='c011'>Things went on in this way till the end of the harvest,
when Geir went up to her, and thanked her kindly for
the help she had given them.</p>

<p class='c011'>She took what he said in good part, and no longer refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>to talk with him. They had a long chat together,
but Geir was not made a bit the wiser, as to where she
lived, or whose daughter she was. She told him, however,
that her name was Una.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Una,” said he to her at last, “I am greatly in want
of a housekeeper; I <a id='tn236'></a>don’t know any body so likely to
suit as you; will you take the situation?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no objection to do so,” she replied, “when
do you want me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sooner the better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I shall come with my luggage to-morrow, and
take up my abode with you.” She then disappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next morning, she walked into the farm house, and
set down a large chest, full of clothes, which she had
brought with her. This she put out of the way in the
closet, and then began to bustle about the house, looking
after household duties.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now things began to prosper again with the
Randafell farmer. Una was a capital manager, and
soon became famous all over the country side for her
good butter, and her well ordered house. Geir was
delighted with his housekeeper; but one thing distressed
him—he could not persuade her to go to church.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Christmas Eve came round, Geir and all the
servants went to church, to the vesper service. Geir was
anxious that Una should go too. But no! she would
not budge, excusing herself by saying, that she was needed
at home to look after the house. It was morning before
the church goers got back, for the church was a good
three hours’ ride from Randafell. On returning they
found Una busy preparing the Christmas feast. The
ordinary work of the house was done, so that they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>nothing to do but to take a few hours rest, before sitting
down to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the time the third winter came round, Geir began
to think of taking a wife, and who so likely to suit him
as Una! And so thought all the neighbours too. Many
a talk they had about her, when gathered together in
the churchyard, on the Sundays, waiting the arrival of
the clergyman. After discussing her good qualities,
“Isn’t it strange,” the one would say to the other, “that
we can’t find out who Una is, or where she comes from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye! that is true,” another would say, “but isn’t
it stranger still, that all the time she has been at
Randafell, she has never once entered the church door?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Geir was very fond of her, but could not make up his
mind to ask her to marry him, so long as she refused to
bend her knee in prayer to God.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the third Christmas Eve, Geir set out, with all his
household, to the midnight service in the church. Una
as usual remained at home. When they were on the
road, Geir’s serving man suddenly complained of severe
pain. He lay down on the spot, and said he would rest
there till he got better; so Geir and the others went on
without him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as they were out of sight, the man got up to his
feet, mounted his horse and rode back again to the farm.
His sickness was only feigned, in order to get the chance
of finding out what could tempt Una always to stay at
home, at a time when every true hearted Icelander made
a point of joining his neighbours, in the house of God,
to commemorate the anniversary of that blessed night
when Christ was born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p class='c011'>On reaching the farm, he unsaddled the horse, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>slipped quietly in, taking care to hide in a dark corner
where he could see all that was going on, without being
himself seen. Una was busy sweeping and cleaning the
house; and so cleverly did she go about her work that
everything was put to rights in a very short time. After
washing herself, she went to the store-closet and put on
a dress which the man had never seen till now, and
which was more befitting a king’s daughter than a poor
farmer’s housekeeper. Never before had Una looked so
handsome and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c011'>She now took out of her chest a piece of red cloth,
which she put under her arm. Shutting her chest and
the closet door, she left the house and ran down the
meadow, till she came to a pool of water. Here she
spread out the red cloth, and placed herself upon it. At
this instant the man, who had been breathlessly following
her, came up, and unseen by her just succeeded in
getting his foot on a corner of the cloth. And now they
sunk down and down into the earth, with a feeling as if
they were going through smoke. By and by they landed
on a green plain, not far from a splendid farm house.
Una took up the cloth, put it under her arm, and went
up to the house. The man walked softly behind, taking
care to keep out of her sight. A great many people
came out of doors to welcome Una, who seemed rejoiced
to see them, and saluted them kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Great preparations were going on inside for a feast.
The guest chamber was swept and garnished, and the
table laid. As soon as the people took their places
several dishes were brought, and abundance of good wine.
The serving man, who had slipped in with the others
unknown to Una, took his place among the guests.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Among other things he was presented with a fine rib of
smoked mutton, which he took and preserved, for he had
never seen so fat a rib before. After supper the people
amused themselves with games of different kinds, and
were all very happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just as day began to break, Una told her friends, she
would have to go away, as her master, the peasant, would
soon be back from church. So she took a kind leave
of every one, and walked to the spot where she had
alighted, on coming down.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man followed her, and again succeeded in getting
his foot on the cloth, without being seen. So they ascended
together through the dark earth, till they came
to the pool of water again. Una took up the cloth, and
went straight to the store-room to change her dress.
After that she went into the house, to await the return
of the peasant, and make ready the Christmas feast.</p>

<p class='c011'>The serving man had, meantime, taken up his place
at the spot where he had been left behind the night before.
When the farmer came up he asked him how he
was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am almost well again,” said the man, “and quite
able to go home with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So they all rode together to Randafell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Una received them with a smiling face, and told them
that the feast was quite ready. So they were not long
in taking their places. As is usual on such occasions,
the principal dish was smoked mutton. As this happened
to be very fine, the farmer took up a large rib, and holding
it up said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have any of you ever seen such a rib as this<a id='tn239'></a>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I have; what think you of that,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>serving man, as he held up before them the rib he had
got the night before.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as Una saw this, she changed colour, went out
without saying a single word, and was never afterwards
seen.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s2u3' class='c034'><span class='large'>GILITRUTT.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>Once on a time, a smart active young peasant occupied
a farm under the Eyafialla mountains. As his pasture
land was good, he kept many sheep. These yielded him
no small store of wool, and yet, it was no easy matter for
him to keep a coat on his back; for the wife whom he
had lately married, though young and healthy, was lazy
to a degree, and gave herself little concern about the
affairs of the house. Her husband was greatly dissatisfied,
but could not induce her to mend her ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the close of summer he gave her a large bundle
of wool, and told her to be sure to spin it and work it up
into coarse wadmal during the winter months. “Very
well,” she said, “I’ll see about it bye and bye;” but at
the same time looked as if she would far rather have
nothing to do with it. She let it lie in a corner untouched,
spite of the hints she got every now and then,
from her husband. It was mid-winter before she fully
made up her mind to set to work; and then she began
to perplex herself, as to how she could get so much wool
worked up, before the close of winter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then, an ugly old woman came to the door,
begging for alms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you do any work for me in return,” asked the
peasant’s wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps I can,” replied the old woman.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“But what kind of work would you have me to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you to make some coarse cloth for me, out of
this wool.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, let me have the wool then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so, the peasant’s wife handed the large bag of
wool to the old woman, who, without more ado, tossed it
up on her back, at the same time saying,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may depend on my coming back with the
cloth, the first day of summer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what payment will you ask for your work when
you bring the cloth,” said the peasant’s wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I <a id='tn241'></a>won’t take any payment; but you must tell me
what my name is, in three guesses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The peasant’s wife, too lazy to spin and weave for
herself, agreed to this strange condition, and so the old
woman departed.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the winter months passed on, the peasant often
asked what had become of the wool.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give yourself no concern about it,” said the wife,
“you’ll have it back, all spun and woven, by the first
day of summer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he never could get any other answer, he at last
ceased to talk about the wool. All this time his wife was
trying to find out the old woman’s name, but all her efforts
were unavailing. By the time the last month of winter
came round she became so anxious and uneasy that she
could neither eat nor sleep. Her husband was greatly
distressed at the change which had come over her, and
begged her to let him know what ailed her. Unable
longer to keep the matter secret, she told him the whole.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was very much startled at what he heard, and told
her how very imprudent she had been, as the old woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>was, most certainly, a witch, and would take her away if
she failed in her bargain.</p>

<p class='c011'>A day or two after this conversation, he had occasion
to go up the adjoining mountain. He was so bowed
down with grief, at the thought of losing his wife, that
he scarcely knew what he was about; and so wandered
from the road, till he came to the bottom of a lofty cliff.
While he was considering how he could get into the right
road again, he thought he heard a sound as of a voice
inside the hill. Following the sound he discovered a
hole in the face of the cliff. On peeping through this
hole, he saw a tall old woman sitting weaving with the
loom between her knees; and, as she beat the treadles,
every now and then breaking into a snatch of song,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ha! Ha! and Ho! Ho!</div>
      <div class='line'>The good wife does not know</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That Gilitrutt is my name.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Aha!” muttered the peasant to himself, <a id='tn242'></a>“if she does
not know now, she will know bye and bye;” for he felt
quite sure that was the same old hag who had so imposed
on his poor foolish wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the way home, he kept repeating the word
<i>Gilitrutt</i>, and, as soon as he got in doors, he wrote it
down on a piece of paper, that he might not forget it. But
he did not, at that time, give his wife the least inkling
of what had befallen him. The poor woman grew more
and more sorrowful, as the days passed on; and, when
the closing day of winter came, she was so woe-begone
that she had not the heart even to put on her clothes.
In the course of the day, her husband enquired if she
had found out her visitor’s name yet.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Alas, no! Would to God I could find it out! for
I am like to die of grief.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no occasion for that,” he replied cheerfully,
“I’ve found out the name for you; so you need not be
afraid to meet the old hag.” With that, he handed her
the piece of paper, and at the same time told about his
adventure on the mountain. She took the paper, with a
trembling hand, for at first she feared that the news
was too good to be true; and, though her husband’s story
comforted her not a little, she could not get rid of a
suspicion that the name might not be the true one.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wanted her husband to stay indoors the next day,
so as to be present when the old woman called.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! no!” said he, “you kept your own counsel when
you gave her the wool, so, you must do without me when
you take in the cloth, and pay her the wages agreed on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He then left the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now came the first day of summer. The peasant’s
wife was in the house alone, and lay a-bed, listening with
a beating heart for the first sound of the old hag’s footsteps.
She had not long to wait; for, before the morning
passed, a trampling noise was heard, and in stalked the
old woman with a bundle on her back, and a scowl on
her face. As soon as she got within the room, she threw
down the big bundle of cloth, and, in an angry tone,
called out,</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is my name now? What’s my name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The peasant’s wife, who was almost dead with fear,
said “Signy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That my name! That my name! guess again, good
wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Asa,” said she.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“That my name! That my name! No indeed. You
must guess again; but remember this is your last chance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you not called Gilitrutt?” said the woman timorously.</p>

<p class='c011'>This answer came like a thunderbolt on the old hag,
who fell down with a great noise on the floor, and lay
there for sometime. She then got up, and, without
speaking a word, went her way out of the house, and
was never more seen in the country-side.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for the peasant’s wife, she was full of joy at her
deliverance, and, ever after, was a changed woman. She
became a pattern of industry and good management, and
henceforth always worked her own wool herself.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s2u4' class='c034'><span class='large'>HILDUR THE FAIRY QUEEN.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>Once on a time a farmer settled in a mountainous part
of the country, but the particular spot is not mentioned,
nor has his name come to us; but we do know that he
was a bachelor, and had a housekeeper named Hildur.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who Hildur was, neither the farmer nor any of the
neighbouring gossips could find out: but as she took
good care of the household and discharged her duties
faithfully, she was allowed to keep her own secret. All
the servants liked her, and the farmer thought himself
very fortunate in having fallen in with such a housekeeper.
She was of a quiet disposition, but always
kind and obliging.</p>

<p class='c011'>The farmer’s affairs were in a flourishing state: his
sheep throve and multiplied, and he had nothing to
annoy him except this, that he had great difficulty in
getting shepherds to enter his service. The cause of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>was not that the farmer treated his shepherds badly, but
that, one after another, they were found dead in bed, on
Christmas morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>In olden times, it was the custom for the Icelanders,
on Christmas Eve, to meet together at midnight for
public worship; and any one who absented himself from
church, on that occasion, was considered as much to
blame as if he were keeping away on Christmas day itself.
Those living up among the mountains, and who
had long weary roads to go, had often great difficulty in
getting to church in time; especially those who were not
able to leave home before the Pleiades could be seen in
the south-eastern heavens.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this farm, the shepherds did not usually get home
from work before that time, so that they generally
missed the opportunity of attending the Christmas Eve
service. Hildur never went on those occasions, as she
preferred staying at home to watch the house—as is
customary for some one to do on Christmas Eve—and
attend to the preparations for the Christmas feast. She
was always busily occupied in this way till the night was
far advanced, so that the church-goers were back from
the services and asleep in bed, before she retired for the
night.</p>

<p class='c011'>As often as Christmas morn came round, the farmer’s
shepherd, whoever he might be, was found dead in bed.
This strange fatality was well known over all the country
side. No wonder, then, that shepherds were afraid of
entering the farmer’s service, even though offered better
wages than they could get elsewhere. No mark of violence
was ever seen on the body of the unfortunate shepherd,
so that no blame could be attached either to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>farmer, or to any one in the house. At last the farmer
declared that he could not find it in his heart to engage
shepherds, with the prospect of certain death before
them, and that he would, for the future, leave his sheep
to take care of themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>When things had reached this pass, there came to
him, one day, an active hardy man, who offered his
services as shepherd.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not so much in want of your services as to be
willing to take you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you engaged a shepherd for next winter?”
asked the stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I have not,” replied the farmer, “but surely you
have heard how sad has been the end of all that have
been before you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes, I’ve heard all about it; but their fate will
not hinder me from taking care of your sheep, if you are
only willing to engage me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, the farmer complied with his entreaties, and
engaged him as shepherd. He soon shewed that he was
in every respect fitted for the place. He was kind and
obliging; and both able and willing to lend a hand at
any farm work, so that he soon became a favourite with
everybody.</p>

<p class='c011'>Till Christmas-tide, nothing extraordinary happened.
On Christmas Eve, the farmer went to church as usual
with his domestics. The housekeeper alone stayed at
home, and the shepherd was left in charge of the sheep.
Towards evening the shepherd came in from his work,
and after partaking of dinner, lay down to rest in bed.
He took care, however, not to drop asleep; for, though
free from fear, he thought it only prudent to keep awake.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>When the night was advanced he heard the church-goers
come in, and take some refreshment before going to bed.
Up till this time, he had not remarked anything unusual;
but when the others had fallen asleep, he felt languid
and weary. He was afraid lest he should be overpowered
with sleep, and did his best to keep awake. A
little while after, some one, whom he believed to be the
housekeeper Hildur, stealthily approached the bed-side.
Thinking he was asleep, she began to try to put something
in his mouth. He felt certain that it must be a
magic-bridle, and so, pretending to be quite unconscious
of what was going on, he let himself be quietly bridled.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as the bridle was on, she led him out very
easily; mounting on his back, she rode away at a smart
pace till they reached a yawning chasm in the earth.
Then she dismounted beside a stone, and letting go her
hold of the bridle, disappeared into the chasm. The
shepherd did not want to lose sight of her, and so tried
to follow; but he soon found that that was out of his
power, so long as he had on the bridle. By dint
however of rubbing his head against the stone, he got
rid of the bridle, and leaving it behind, he threw
himself into the chasm into which Hildur had sprung.</p>

<p class='c011'>As far as he could judge, he had not gone very deep
down till he saw Hildur again. She was then landed on
a fine level meadow, along which she was walking
quickly. From what he saw he came to think that all
was not right with Hildur, and that she was not the
woman she had seemed to be in the farmer’s house. In
order to keep her from seeing him as he followed her
over the plain, he took out of his pocket a stone which
had the wonderful property of making him invisible so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>long as he held it in his hand. With this stone of
darkness in his left-palm, he made after her as fast as he
could, and kept close behind her the rest of the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>After walking some distance over the plain, there
appeared in sight a splendid palace of great size,
towards which Hildur directed her steps. A great
crowd of people came out to meet her. Foremost
among them was a man dressed in purple and gold, who
bade her welcome, at the same time calling her his
beloved wife, and embracing her very affectionately.
Those who attended him saluted her as their queen, and
received her with every mark of respect. By the king’s
side were two children, of eight or ten years of age, who
ran joyfully into Hildur’s arms, and called her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>On entering the palace, Hildur was very honourably
received. She was dressed in a royal robe, and had
rings of gold put upon her hand. The shepherd followed
the crowd into the palace, and took up his place where
he could see all that was going on without running the
risk of being found out. The furniture was rich and
gorgeous beyond conception, so that he was completely
dazzled with the sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the principal saloon a table was set out and a
feast prepared, the splendour of which cannot be described.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hildur then made her appearance, magnificently
attired, and sat down on the throne beside the king,
while the other guests took their places on each side.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the close of the feast, the table was removed, and
soon the guests began to pass the time in dancing, or
other amusements. The king and queen paid no heed
to what was going on, but sat alone, engaged in a close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>conversation which seemed to the shepherd to be at
once kind and sorrowful.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the king and queen were thus occupied, three
children, younger than those before mentioned, came
forward, and their mother Hildur, who received them
kindly, took the youngest on her knee and fondled it.
But, as the child was restless and uneasy, she set it
down again. She then drew a ring from her finger, and
gave it to the child as a plaything. The child amused
itself for some time with it, and then dropped it on the
floor. The shepherd, who was standing close by, at the
time, hastily snatched it up and put it into his pocket,
without being observed by any one. As soon as the
ring was missed, a careful search was made for it, but, to
the great astonishment of everybody but the shepherd,
it was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the night was now far advanced, the queen—Hildur—began
to prepare for her departure. Those
present were sorry to see this, and begged her to stay
longer with them. The king also added his entreaties,
but all without effect. Before this time, the shepherd
had noticed an ill-looking woman, who sat all alone in a
corner of the room. She was the only one that had
failed to give Hildur a joyful welcome to the palace, or
ask her to prolong her stay. As soon as the king saw
that Hildur was bent on going, he stepped up to this
old woman, and said, “Take back your words, mother!
at my humble entreaty, so that my queen may no
longer be bound to absent herself from home, and from
those nearest and dearest to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old woman replied angrily, “All my words shall
stand, I will by no means retract them.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>With a sorrowful heart, he went back to the queen,
and, folding his arms around her, begged her in words
of kindness not to leave him again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alas,” said she, “I cannot stay here, in consequence
of the spell by which your mother has bound me, and
who knows if I shall ever see you more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She then told him she had killed so many men it
could no longer be concealed, and that she would
certainly be punished, even though what she had done
was sore against her will.</p>

<p class='c011'>While she was lamenting her unhappy lot, the
shepherd, seeing how matters stood, made the best of
his way out of the palace, and went straightway to the
bottom of the chasm. He reached the top, with the
greatest ease. After that, he put the stone of darkness
in his pocket, and putting the bridle in his mouth again,
waited patiently on Hildur. It was not long before
Hildur made her appearance, looking very sorrowful.
Taking a hold of the bridle, she mounted on his back
and rode quickly back to the farm.</p>

<p class='c011'>On her arrival she laid the shepherd quietly in bed,
and unbridled him, and then slipped away to her own
bed, where she lay down to sleep. Although the
shepherd had been all this time wide awake, he feigned
sleep so well that Hildur was quite deceived. After she
had gone to bed, he was no longer on his guard, but fell
asleep, and as might be expected slept till it was broad
day. The farmer was astir early in the morning, for he
was anxious to know if this Christmas, like so many that
was gone, was to be a season of mourning in place of a
season of rejoicing. The most of the servants got up
early too, but, while they were dressing, he went quietly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>to the shepherd’s bed, and touching him with his hand,
found that he was alive and apparently well. This
rejoiced the heart of the farmer, who falling down on
his knees, praised God loudly for his great goodness.
The shepherd, shortly after, got up in the best of health.
As soon as he was dressed, the people of the house
gathered about him, to ask if anything unusual had
befallen him during the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing,” said he, “except that I had a very wonderful
dream.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What kind of a dream?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The shepherd began with the tale, as it is here told;
how Hildur came to his bed and bridled him; and every
thing exactly, as far as he could recollect. When he had
done, all were silent except Hildur, who said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you tell the truth, show us some token to prove
what you say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The shepherd, noways daunted by this demand, shewed
them the ring, which he had picked up from the floor of
the fairy palace during the night, and said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Though I am not bound to bring forward proofs, I
can easily do so, for there is token sufficient that I have
been with the fairies. Is not that your ring, Queen
Hildur?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To be sure it is,” replied Hildur “and may good
fortune ever attend you, for you have delivered me from
the spell by which my cruel mother-in-law bound me,
and through which I have been compelled to do so many
bad deeds which my soul abhorred.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then queen Hildur told her story as follows. “I was
a fairy maid of low degree, but the present fairy king
fell in love with me. The marriage was so displeasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>to his mother, that she became furious with rage and told
him that he would have to part with me soon, and that,
after that, we could enjoy each other’s society only at
rare intervals and for a short time together. But me
she bound with such a spell, that I was forced to become
a servant in the world of woe, and, every Christmas Eve,
to kill a man. I was to bridle him when asleep, and ride
on his back along the same road that I took with the
shepherd last night in going to meet the king. This
I was to do till I was convicted of murder and put to
death, unless, before that, I should fall in with a man so
courageous as to dare to go with me to the world of
<a id='tn252'></a>Fairies, and then be able to show plain proofs that he
had been there and seen what was done. Now, it is
clear that all the other shepherds of this farmer have
suffered death for my sake, but, as it was not in my
power to prevent it, I hope their deaths will not be laid
to my charge. This stout-hearted man is the first who
dared to venture into the dark road that leads to Fairyland.
I shall yet reward him for delivering me from
the spell of my cruel mother-in-law. I thank you all
for your kindness to me, during the years I have been
among you. But I must stay here no longer, for I long
for my proper home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After these words Queen Hildur disappeared, and
since then, she has never once been seen in the world of
mankind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the shepherd, it is told, that he married and
settled down on a farm, in the following spring. He
was generously treated by the farmer, who, when they
parted, stocked his farm free of all cost to him. Ere
long he became noted as one of the best farmers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>neighbourhood, and was often called upon for his advice
and assistance in matters of difficulty. He was beloved
by all, and successful beyond all his expectations in
whatever he undertook. None of his neighbours could
boast of such thriving flocks and herds as his. But his
wonderful good fortune did not make him proud, for, as
he often said, he owed all his success to Hildur the
Fairy Queen.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s2u5' class='c034'><span class='large'>A CLERGYMAN’S DAUGHTER MARRIED TO A FAIRY MAN.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>In a certain district of Iceland, there lived a clergyman
who had a daughter in the early bloom of womanhood.
One day, when the conversation turned on the
subject of elves or fairies, the young woman happened
to say,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like to be married to a fairy man, if he
were only a brave one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father was very angry at her words, and gave her
a good scolding and a box on the ear besides. Shortly
afterwards, a child about the parsonage saw a man ride
up to the door of the house, and then dismount. Watching
his opportunity, the man stepped indoors, and soon
reappeared, leading the clergyman’s daughter by the
hand. Before he could be prevented, he mounted on
horseback and rode off with her. Her sorrowful parents
searched for her throughout all the neighbouring country,
but nowhere could she be found.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is told, that three winters after this time, a shepherd
who had been long in the clergyman’s service, and had
loved his daughter dearly, one day lost his way and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the sheep. After wandering about for hours, he found
himself at the door of a farm house he had never before
seen. The farmer, a fine manly looking fellow, came out,
and after listening to his story offered him a bed for the
night. He accepted the offer gladly, but at the same
time lamented over the loss of the sheep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t bother yourself about them to-night,” said the
farmer, “be sure they will turn up again;” and with
that he led him to a room up stairs. There he saw an
old man and woman, and two children who were playing
on the floor. But, besides these, he saw the clergyman’s
lost daughter who was now the wife of the man who had
asked him in.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shepherd was entertained with the best that was
in the house; and when bed-time came, was shown to a
private sleeping room. The clergyman’s daughter then
went to him, and handing him a leather bag, asked him
faithfully to deliver to her mother some valuables she
had put in it. She also bade him tell her mother that
though her husband was a fairy man, he did not hinder
her from saying her prayers every night. On the shepherd
asking her if ever she went to church, she said
she was there just as often as himself, and that she
always sat under the pulpit, with her husband, beside
the altar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How does it come that nobody ever sees you in
church?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, the reason is,” she replied, “that we always leave
the church before the blessing. But <a id='tn254'></a>don’t tell anybody
what I have now mentioned. Only deliver the leather
bag to my mother; for if you blab what I’ve told you, be
sure you will be an unfortunate man.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>He gave her a promise of secrecy; on that, she left the
room. On getting up in the morning, he was glad to
learn that his lost sheep had turned up. The farmer,
who had fed them on hay during the night, delivered
them up to him, and put him on the right road. He
got home with the sheep in safety, and after a very short
journey; but he never could tell which way he came.
As for the promise of secrecy, he paid no attention to it;
but on the contrary gave a full and exact account of
everything he had seen and heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, the clergyman, who was anxious to find his
daughter, bethought himself of a plan, and that was, to
pronounce the blessing before she could have time to
get out of church. So he went round among his
<a id='tn255'></a>parishioners, and told them not to be shocked if they
should hear him the next Sunday pronounce the blessing
at an earlier stage of the service than usual. When
next Sunday came, his daughter occupied her customary
seat, though not visible to any one in the church. In
the middle of the service the clergyman stopped and
pronounced the blessing. His daughter, thus caught
unawares, was obliged to discover herself. He did what
he could to induce her to stay, but all in vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you try to force me,” said she, “the consequences
will be very serious; and besides, it would not be right
in me to leave a husband who has always treated me so
kindly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the shepherd, it is told, that he was from that day
unfortunate in all that he had to do with. But one
cannot be sorry for him, as he brought his troubles on
his own head through his want of truthfulness.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h5 id='ap1s2u6' class='c034'><span class='large'>THE CLERGYMAN’S DAUGHTER IN PRESTSBAKKI.</span></h5>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In Prestsbakki, in the Skaptáfells district, there once
lived a clergyman, named Einar. He was well to do in
the world, and had a numerous family. No one cared
less about fairy tales than he did. In fact, he used to
speak of fairies as if there were no such beings. In his
idle moments he would tauntingly dare them to shew
themselves to him; and then, as they did not choose to
obey his orders, he would boast that there were no
fairies to come.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, on one night while asleep, he dreamed that a
man came to his bedside and said to him,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have provoked the fairies long, but now they
will have their revenge. From this time forward you
shall not dare to deny their existence. I will take away
your eldest daughter, and you shall never see her more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And sure enough, in the morning, when the clergyman
awoke, he found that his eldest daughter, who was twelve
years of age, had disappeared. Search was made for her
in all directions, but nowhere could she be found. As
time passed on, she often made her appearance among
her brothers and sisters, while they were playing in the
meadows. Again and again, they tried to prevail on her
to go home with them; but, just as she seemed willing
to do so, she always became invisible. When asked as
to her welfare, she always said that she was in good
health, and kindly treated by her new friends. Her
father frequently saw her in his dreams, and to him she
told the same story, only adding that she was to be
married, bye and bye, to the fairy clergyman’s son. Some
time after she appeared to her father again in a dream,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>and invited him to come to her marriage, which was to
take place on the following day. This was the last time
he ever dreamed about her, and never after did she show
herself among her brothers and sisters.</p>

<h5 id='ap1s2u7' class='c034'><span class='large'>THE CHANGELING.</span></h5>

<p class='c021'>It was a common belief, in olden times, that the fairies
often took away infant children who happened to be left
alone, and changed them for decrepit old men or women
who were made to appear as children. These changelings,
however, neither grew nor spoke after the manner
of children, and were very apt to become idiots. It
once happened that all the people of a certain farm were
working in the meadows, except the mistress of the house
who was at home looking after the house and her little
son, a boy three or four years old. Up to that time the
boy had thriven amazingly. He could talk well, and
was a clever promising child. As there was no one to
assist the mother with the household work, one day, she
was obliged to leave the boy by himself for a short time,
while she went to wash the milk pails in a brook close
by. On returning soon after, she was surprised to find
the boy, at the door, weeping and howling in a strange
uncouth way, very different from his wonted manner.
Usually he was very quiet, gentle and obedient, but now
she could not get a word out of him. Time passed on,
but the child remained silent, restless, and thoroughly
untractable. His body ceased to grow, and his behaviour
was like that of an idiot. His mother could not account
for the strange change that had come over him. In the
midst of her grief, she at last bethought herself of going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>to take the advice of a neighbour woman who was
famous for her prudence and skill. The neighbour
listened attentively to all she had to say about the boy,
and then said to her,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you think, good wife, that the boy is a
changeling? for, it seems to me, that the fairies must
have taken away your own boy the day you left him
alone, and have put another in his place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How could I find out, if what you say is true?” said
the surprised mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, very easily, just go home, and take the first
opportunity of leaving the boy alone beside something
that is likely to call forth his surprise. When his eye
catches what you have put purposely in his way, if
nobody is within sight, he is sure to make some remark
about it to himself. You must listen to what he says,
and if you find anything strange or suspicious about it,
go in at once and flog him without mercy, till something
comes out of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy’s mother thanked her neighbour humbly for
her advice, and went away home to put it into practice.
The first thing she did on returning was to place the
little porridge pot in the middle of the kitchen floor.
She then bound a great many sticks together, so as to
make a long rod, and fastened the spurtle to one of the
ends. The rod was so big, that when the spurtle rested
in the pot, the upper end was away up the chimney.
Leaving it in this position, she went away and fetched
the boy to the kitchen, and then left him all alone. On
going out, she drew the door behind her; but not so
closely as to prevent her from peeping in to see what
was going on.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>As soon as the boy thought he was alone, he began to
trip round the pot, wondering greatly what could be the
meaning of the long spurtle. At last he said, “Well, old
as I am, and I am no chicken now, as my grey beard
and my eighteen children in Fairyland can testify, I
never, in all my born days, did see such a long spurtle
for such a little porridge pot.<a id='tn259'></a>”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was enough for the mother, who was not long of
making her appearance in the kitchen with a good
sized stick in her hand. Seizing hold of the changeling,
she flogged him unmercifully for a long while, spite of
his heart-rending cries.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bye and bye a strange old woman walked in, holding
on her arms a little boy whom she fondled kindly.
Addressing the farmer’s wife, she said, “Why should
you treat my husband so cruelly. Your conduct is a
sorry recompense for the care I have bestowed on this
little boy of yours.” So saying, she laid the little boy
at his mother’s feet, and took her husband away with
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fairy man and woman were never more seen
again. The now recovered boy remained with his
parents, and grew up a fine manly youth, the joy of his
mother’s heart.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>In the “Völuspá,”<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> from the older Edda, we have a
sublime description of chaos; of creation; an account of
a period of strife, crime, and suffering; dire conflicts between
the powers of good and evil; of the destruction
of the world of Odin and the dissolution and conflagration
of the universe; of the Regnarök or twilight of the
Gods; of the renovated world, the descent of Baldur the
Good, the punishment of the wicked, and the happiness
of the good in Gimlé or Heaven. From this poem—the
most remarkable in the whole range of Scandinavian
mytho-cosmogony—the following verses are extracted:</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>From the heroic poems relating to Sigurd and Brynhild—the
originals from which the German “<a id='tn265a'></a>Niebelungen-lied”
is taken—the following passage is extracted. In it
Gudrun, in conversation with Thjodreck, describes her
youth before the murder of Sigurd: “A maid was I
amongst maidens; my mother reared me lovely in bower.
Well loved I my brothers, till me Gjuké apportioned
with gold, with gold apportioned and gave me to Sigurd.
So raised himself, Sigurd, over the sons of Gjuké, as the
green lily above the grass grows; or the high-antlered
stag, above other beasts; or the fire-red gold above the
silver grey. My brothers were incensed that I should
have a husband more <a id='tn265b'></a>illustrious than any. Sleep they
could not, nor decide on anything, before they Sigurd
had caused to perish. Grangé (Sigurd’s steed) galloped
to the <i>Ting</i> (assembly of the people), wild was his
neighing, but Sigurd himself was not there. All the
horses were covered with sweat, and with blood of the
contenders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Weeping I went to speak to Grané, the blood
sprinkled; of his master I asked him; then hung down
Grané <a id='tn265c'></a>mournfully his head, for the creature knew that his
lord was not living. Long did I wander, long was I
confused in mind before of the Prince I could ask after
my King.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The “Hávamál”—<a id='tn265d'></a>“Odin’s High Song”—displays a
shrewd insight into human nature, and contains many
maxims, both of a moral and social kind, which one
would scarcely expect to find embodied in the heathen
ethics of an ancient Scandinavian Scald. The whole
poem is here presented to the reader.</p>

    <div>A LETTER RECEIVED FROM THE REV. OLAF PÁLSSON IN ANSWER TO</div>
    <div>QUERIES ABOUT TRAVELLING IN ICELAND.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class='c036'>

<div class='c004'>Reykjavik, 20th Nov. 1861.</div>

<p class='c011'>My Dear Friend,</p>

<p class='c011'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to your wish in your
kind note of 15th August this year, I will now try to
give some answers to the queries you have there put to
me, about several matters which it may be useful for
strangers who travel in Iceland to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have since conferred with Zöga, who is assuredly the
very best guide in this place, and well versed in these
matters. The hints that I am able to give are as follows,
and correspond to the order of the queries put.</p>

<p class='c011'>1st. I have not such an extensive acquaintance with
the coasts of Iceland as to be able to describe all places of
shelter that might be found around the island; for doubtless
they are many. But I am sure, that it will not be
advisable for any foreign vessel to approach the south
coast; for, from Cape Reykjanes to Berufiord, there is no
shelter at all along the whole south side of Iceland, except
in the Westmanna Islands, which lie some ten miles
from the shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a general rule, every merchant place, marked on
the map, will be found tolerably safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>2d. For the Englishman who arrives at Reykjavik, or
for any traveller who has some knowledge of English, it
is not absolutely necessary to know other languages; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>guides who know that language can be had there, and
these make tolerably good interpreters in the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>This, however, will scarcely be the case in any other
merchant place in Iceland.</p>

<p class='c011'>3d. As to expenses of travelling; I can only remark
that a guide is paid about 2 rix dollars<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a> a day (4/6).</p>

<p class='c011'>Every gentleman will be obliged to have two ponies
each at 64 skillings per day (1/5). A jack horse is to
be got at 48 skillings per day, and will not comfortably
carry more than 100 to 120 lbs. weight. If this horse is
provided with pack saddle and chests for preserving
goods in, it will cost 64 skillings. If the travellers
should wish to be away for a longer time from human
habitations, it will be necessary for them to bring with
them a tent, a sufficient quantity of victuals, &#38;c. Thus
it will be found that two gentlemen travelling cannot
easily do with less than five pack horses, and then they
will require to have two guides, one to take care of the
horses and baggage, and the other to attend upon themselves
when they wish to travel faster, or to visit places
where the train of baggage horses cannot easily go with
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>From this I hope an idea can be formed of the average
cost of such travelling for a week or so. For a
more protracted journey through the island, it will certainly
be preferable to buy the horses, and dispose of
them again by auction on returning to Reykjavik. The
average price of a pack horse will be 24 rix dollars, and
for a riding pony 30 to 40 rix dollars. They will again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>sell at a half, or at least a third of the money, according
to the length of the journey, their condition, and the
season of the year. This calculation is made for a
journey begun from Reykjavik, which in most respects
will be found the most convenient place to start from.</p>

<p class='c011'>4th. An india-rubber boat will very probably be serviceable,
but it will seldom be needed; for on almost
every one of the larger rivers there are plenty of ferries.</p>

<p class='c011'>5th. The very best month for travelling in Iceland
undoubtedly is July, and next to it August. A journey
can be begun in the middle of June. At an earlier time
there will not be sufficient grass for the horses. The
journey can usually, without the risk of getting bad
weather, be prolonged to the middle of September.</p>

<p class='c011'>These, my dear sir, are all the hints I am able to give
you. I am sure there are many other things which
might be taken into consideration, but I have written
this to my best ability, although in great haste, which
may excuse the many faults I am sure will be found
with my English. With my best wishes &#38;c.</p>

<div class='c004'>Yours very truly,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </div>
<div class='c004'><span class='sc'>O. Pálsson</span>.</div>

<p class='c037'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The screw steamer <i>Arcturus</i> makes six trips during the
season, carrying the mails from Copenhagen to Iceland, and calling at
Grangemouth and the Faröe Islands. The first sailing north is generally
about the beginning of March, and the last towards the end of
October. Fares—First cabin £5; second do. £3 10s. Return—only
available for the same voyage—first cabin £9; second do. £6. Further
information may be obtained by applying to Mr. P. L. Henderson, 20
Dixon Street, Glasgow; Messrs. David Robertson &#38; Co., Grangemouth;
or Messrs. Koch &#38; Henderson, Copenhagen.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'>Few subjects possess greater interest for the British
race than the Scandinavian North, with its iron-bound
rampart of wave-lashed rocks, its deeply indented fiords,
bold cliffs, rocky promontories, abrupt headlands, wild
skerries, crags, rock-ledges, and caves, all alive with
gulls, puffins and kittiwakes; and in short, the general
and striking picturesqueness of its scenery, to say
nothing of the higher human interest of its stirring
history, and the rich treasures of its grand old literature.</p>

<p class='c011'>The British race has been called Anglo-Saxon; made
up however, as it is, of many elements—Ancient Briton,
Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Dane, Norman, and Scandinavian—the
latter predominates so largely over the others as
to prove by evidence, external and internal, and not to
be gainsaid, that the Scandinavians are our true progenitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Germans are a separate branch of the same great
Gothic family, industrious, but very unlike us in many
respects. The degree of resemblance and affinity may
be settled by styling them honest but unenterprising
inland friends, whose ancestors and ours were first cousins
upwards of a thousand years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the old Northmen—hailing from the sea-board of
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark—may be traced the
germs of all that is most characteristic of the modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Briton, whether personal, social, or national. The configuration
of the land, and the numerous arms of the sea
with which the north-west of Europe is indented, necessitated
boats and seamanship. From these coasts, the
Northmen—whether bent on piratical plundering expeditions,
or peacefully seeking refuge from tyrannical
oppression at home—sallied forth in their frail barks or
skiffs, which could live in the wildest sea, visiting and
settling in many lands. We here mention, in geographical
order, Normandy, England, Scotland, Orkney, Shetland,
Faröe, and Iceland. Wherever they have been, they have
left indelible traces behind them, these ever getting more
numerous and distinct as we go northwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anglen, from which the word England is derived, still
forms part of Holstein a province in Denmark; and the
preponderance of the direct Scandinavian element in the
language itself has been shewn by Dean Trench, who
states, that of a hundred English words, sixty come from
the Scandinavian, thirty from the Latin, five from the
Greek, and five from other sources.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Scotland many more Norse words, which sound
quite foreign to an English ear, yet linger amongst the
common people; while, as in England, the original Celtic
inhabitants were driven to the west before the Northmen,
who landed for the most part on the east. In certain
districts of the Orkneys a corrupt dialect of Norse was
spoken till recently, and the Scandinavian type of features
is there often to be met with.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Norse language is still understood and frequently
spoken in Shetland, where the stalwart, manly forms of
the fishermen, the characteristic prevalence of blue eyes
and light flaxen hair, the universal observance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Norse Yule, and many other old-world customs, together
with the oriental and almost affecting regard paid to the
sacred rites of hospitality, on the part of the islanders,
all plainly tell their origin.</p>

<p class='c011'>The language of the Faröe islanders is a dialect of the
Norse, approaching Danish, and peculiar to themselves.
It is called Faröese. The peaceful inhabitants not only
resemble, but are Northmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Iceland we have pure Norse, as imported from
Norway in the ninth century, the lone northern sea
having guarded it, and many other interesting features,
from those modifications to which the Norwegian,
Danish, and Swedish have been subjected by neighbouring
Teutonic or German influences. This language, the
parent, or at least the oldest and purest form of the
various Scandinavian dialects with which we are acquainted,
has been at different times named Dönsk-tunga,
Norræna, or Norse, but latterly it has been simply
called Icelandic, because peculiar to that island.</p>

<p class='c011'>The language, history, and literature of our ancestors
having been thus preserved in the north, we are thereby
enabled to revisit the past, read it in the light of the
present, and make both subservient for good in the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>Herodotus mentions that tin was procured from
Britain. Strabo informs us that the Phœnicians traded
to our island, receiving tin and skins in exchange for
earthenware, salt, and vessels of brass; but our first
authentic particulars regarding the ancient Britons are
derived from Julius <a id='tn295'></a>Cæsar, whose landing on the southern
portion of our island, and hard-won battles, were but
transient and doubtful successes. The original inhabitants
were Celts from France and Spain; but, as we learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>from him, these had long before been driven into the
interior and western portion of the island by Belgians,
who crossed the sea, made good their footing, settled on
the east and south-eastern shores of England, and were
now known as Britons. With these Cæsar had to do.
The intrepid bravery of the well-trained and regularly
disciplined British warriors commanded respect, and left
his soldiers but little to boast of. The Roman legions
never felt safe unless within their entrenchments, and,
even there, were sometimes surprised. Strange to realise
such dire conflicts raging at the foot of the Surrey hills,
probably in the neighbourhood of Penge, Sydenham, and
Norwood, where the Crystal Palace now peacefully stands.
Even in these dark Druid days, the Britons, although
clothed in skins, wearing long hair, and stained blue
with woad, were no mere painted savages as they have
sometimes been represented, but were in possession of
regularly-constituted forms of government. They had
naval, military, agricultural and commercial resources to
depend upon, and were acquainted with many of the
important arts of life. The Briton was simple in his
manners, frugal in his habits, and loved freedom above
all things. Had the brave Caswallon headed the men of
Kent, in their attack upon the Roman maritime camp,
Cæsar and his hosts would never, in all likelihood, have
succeeded in reaching their ships, but would have found
graves on our shores. His admirable commentaries
would not have seen the light of day, and the whole
current of Roman, nay, of the world’s history might have
been changed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our British institutions and national characteristics
were not adopted from any quarter, completely moulded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>and finished, as it were, but everywhere exhibit the
vitality of growth and progress, slow but sure. Each
new element or useful suggestion, from whatever source
derived, has been tested and modified before being
allowed to take root and form part of the constitution.
The germs have been developed in our own soil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, to the Romans, we can trace our municipal institutions—subjection
to a central authority controlling
the rights of individuals. To the Scandinavians, we can
as distinctly trace that principle of personal liberty which
resists absolute control, and sets limits—such as Magna
Charta—to the undue exercise of authority in governors.</p>

<p class='c011'>These two opposite tendencies, when united, like the
centripedal and centrifugal forces, keep society revolving
peacefully and securely in its orbit around the sun of
truth. When severed, tyranny, on the one hand, or
democratic license, on the other—both alike removed
from freedom—must result, sooner or later, in instability,
confusion, and anarchy. France affords us an example
of the one, and America of the other. London is not
Britain in the sense that Paris is France; while Washington
has degenerated into a mere cockpit for North
and South.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the feudal system of the Normans, notwithstanding
its abuses, we have derived the safe tenure and
transmission of land, with protection and security for all
kinds of property. British law has been the growth of
a thousand years, and has been held in so much respect
that even our revolutions have been legally conducted,
and presided over by the staid majesty of justice. Were
more evidences wanting to show that the Scandinavian
element is actually the backbone of the British race—contributing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>its superiority, physical and moral, its
indomitable strength and energy of character—we would
simply mention a few traits of resemblance which incontestably
prove that the “child is father to the man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old Scandinavian possessed an innate love of truth;
much earnestness; respect and honour for woman; love
of personal freedom; reverence, up to the light that was
in him, for sacred things; great self-reliance, combined
with energy of will to dare and do; perseverance in overcoming
obstacles, whether by sea or land; much self-denial,
and great powers of endurance under given circumstances.
These qualities, however, existed along with
a pagan thirst for war and contempt of death, which was
courted on the battle-field that the warrior might rise
thence to Valhalla.</p>

<p class='c011'>To illustrate the love of freedom, even in thought,
which characterises the race, it can be shewn that, while
the Celtic nations fell an easy prey to the degrading
yoke of Romish superstition, spreading its deadly miasma
from the south, the Scandinavian nations, even when for
a time acknowledging its sway, were never bound hand
and foot by it, but had minds of their own, and sooner or
later broke their fetters. In the truth-loving Scandinavian,
Jesuitical Rome has naturally ever met with its
most determined antagonist; for</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In the dark days of the Stuarts, witness the noble
struggles of the Covenanters and the Puritans for civil
and religious liberty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding mixtures and amalgamations of
blood, as a general rule the distinctive tendencies of race
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>survive, and, good or bad, as the case may be, reappear
in new and unexpected forms. Even habit becomes a
second nature, the traces of which, centuries with their
changes cannot altogether obliterate.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other side of the Atlantic, the Puritan Fathers,
their descendants, and men like them, have been the salt
of the north; while many of the planters of the south,
tainted with cavalier blood, continue to foster slavery—“that
sum of all villanies”—and glory in being man-stealers,
man-sellers, and murderers, although cursed of
God, and execrated by all right thinking men. John
Brown of Harper’s Ferry, who was the other day judicially
murdered, we would select as an honoured type of
the noble, manly, brave, truth-loving, God-fearing Scandinavian—<i>The
Times</i> and <i>Athenæum</i> notwithstanding.<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
His heroism in behalf of the poor despised slave had
true moral grandeur in it—it was sublime. America
cannot match it. Washington was great—John Brown
was greater. Washington resisted the imposition of unjust
taxes on himself and his equals, but was a slave-holder;
John Brown unselfishly devoted his energies—nay,
life itself—to obtain freedom for the oppressed, and
to save his country from just impending judgments.
The one was a patriot; the other was a patriot and philanthropist.
The patriotism of Washington was limited
by colour; that of Brown was thorough, and recognised
the sacred rights of man. He was hanged for trying to
accomplish that which his murderers ought to have done—nay,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>deserved to be hanged for not doing—hanged for
that which they shall yet do, if not first overtaken and
whelmed in just and condign vengeance; for the cry of
blood ascends. He was no less a martyr to the cause of
freedom than John Brown of Priesthill, who was ruthlessly
shot by the bloody Claverhouse. These two noble
martyrs, in virtue alike of their name and cause, shall
stand together on the page of future history, when their
cruel murderers and the abettors of them have long gone
to their own place. For such deeds there shall yet be
tears of blood. The wrongs of Italy are not to be named
in comparison with those of the slave. Let those who
boast of a single drop of Scandinavian blood in their
veins no longer withhold just rights from the oppressed—rights
which, if not yielded at this the eleventh hour,
shall be righteously, though fearfully, wrested from the
oppressors, when the hour of retribution comes.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps the two most striking outward resemblances
between Britons and Scandinavians may be found in
their maritime skill, and in their powers of planting
colonies, and governing themselves by free institutions,
representative parliaments, and trial by jury.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Norse rover—bred to the sea, matchless in skill,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>daring, loving adventure and discovery, and with any
amount of pluck—is the true type of the British tar.
In light crafts, the Northmen could run into shallow
creeks, cross the North Sea, or boldly push off to face
the storms of the open Atlantic. These old Vikings
were seasoned “salts” from their very childhood—“creatures
native and imbued unto the element;” neither
in peace nor war, on land nor sea, did they fear anything
but fear.</p>

<p class='c021'>In them we see the forerunners of the buccaneers, and
the ancestors of those naval heroes, voyagers, and discoverers—those
Drakes and Dampiers, Nelsons and
Dundonalds, Cooks and Franklins, who have won for
Britain the proud title of sovereign of the seas—a title
which she is still ready to uphold against all comers.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Shetland, we still find the same skilled seamanship,
and the same light open boat, like a Norwegian yawl;
indeed, planks for building skiffs are generally imported
from Norway, all prepared and ready to put together.
There the peace-loving fishermen, in pursuit of their
perilous calling, sometimes venture sixty miles off to sea,
losing sight of all land, except perhaps the highest peak
of their island-homes left dimly peering just above the
horizon-line. Sometimes they are actually driven, by
stress of weather, within sight of the coast of Norway,
and yet the loss of a skiff in the open sea, however high
the waves run, is a thing quite unknown to the skilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Shetlander. The buoyancy of the skiff (from this word
we have ship and skipper) is something wonderful. Its
high bow and stern enables it to ride and rise over the
waves like a sea-duck, although its chance of living seems
almost as little, and as perilous, as that of the dancing
shallop or mussel-shell we see whelmed in the ripple.
Its preservation, to the onlooker from the deck of a large
vessel, often seems miraculous. It is the practice, in
encountering the stormy blasts of the North Sea, to
lower the lug-sail on the approach of every billow, so as
to ride its crest with bare mast, and to raise it again as
the skiff descends into the more sheltered trough of the
wave. By such constant manœuvering, safety is secured
and progress made. When boats are lost—and such tragedies
frequently occur, sometimes leaving poor lonely
widows bereft, at one fell swoop, of husband, father,
and brothers, for the crews are too often made up of
relatives—it is generally when they are caught and
mastered by strong currents running between the islands,
which neither oar nor sail can stem. Such losses are
always on the coasts—never at sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the Scandinavian powers of colonising:—There is
ample evidence of their having settled in Shetland, Orkney,
and on our coasts, long before those great outgoings
of which we have authentic historical records. To several
of these latter we shall briefly advert, viz., the English,
Russian, Icelandic, American, and Norman.</p>

<p class='c011'>We may first mention that, in remote ages, this race
swept across Europe from the neighbourhood of the region
now called Circassia, lying between the Black Sea and
the Caspian, to the shores of the Baltic, settling on the
north-west coast of Europe. Their traditions, and numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>eastern customs—allied to the Persians and the
inhabitants of the plains of Asia Minor in old Homeric
days—which they brought along with them, all go to
confirm their eastern origin. Nor did they rest here,
but, thirsting for adventure in these grim warrior ages,
sailed forth as pirates or settlers, sometimes both, and,
as can be shewn, made their power and influence felt in
every country of Europe, from Lapland to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c011'>They invaded England in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 429, and founded the
kingdoms of South, West, and East Seaxe, East Anglia,
Mercia, Deira, and Bernicea; thus overrunning and fixing
themselves in the land, from Devonshire to North of
the Humber. From the mixture of these Angles, or
Saxons, as they were termed by the Britons, with the
previous Belgian settlers and original inhabitants, we
have the Anglo-Saxon race. The Jutes who settled in
Kent were from Jutland. In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 787, the Danes ravaged
the coast, beginning with Dorsetshire; and, continuing
to swarm across the sea, soon spread themselves
over the whole country. They had nearly mastered it
all, when Alfred ascended the throne in 871. At length,
in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1017, Canute, after much hard fighting, did
master it, and England had Danish kings from that
period till the Saxon line was restored in 1042.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 862, the Scandinavian Northmen
established the Russian empire, and played a very important
part in the management of its affairs, even after
the subsequent infusion of the Sclavonic element. In
the “Mémoires de la Société Royale des Antiquaries du
Nord,” published at Copenhagen, we find that, of the
fifty names of those composing Ingor’s embassy to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Greek Emperor at Constantinople in the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 994,
only three were Sclavic, and the rest Northmen—names
that occur in the Sagas, such as Ivar, Vigfast, Eylif,
Grim, Ulf, Frode, Asbrand, &#38;c. The Greeks called them
Russians, but Frankish writers simply Northmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 863, Naddodr, a Norwegian, discovered
Iceland,<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> which, however, had been previously
visited and resided in at intervals for at least upwards of
seventy years before that time, by fishermen, ecclesiastics,
and hermits, called Westmen, from Ireland, Iona and
other islands of the Hebrides. Of these visits Naddodr
found numerous traces.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 874, Ingolf with followers, many of whom
were related to the first families in Norway, fleeing from
the tyranny of Harold Harfagra, began the colonisation
of Iceland, which was completed during a space of sixty
years. They established a <a id='tn304'></a>flourishing republic, appointed
magistrates, and held their Althing, or national assembly,
at Thingvalla.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of the Northmen who at various times had
settled on our shores, accompanied by their acquired
relatives, also set sail and joined their brethren; thus
making use of Britain as a stepping stone between
Scandinavia and Iceland. Many traces of these early
links yet remain. We heard of a family in the island
that can trace its descent, in a direct line, from a royal
ancestor of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Thus, in this distant volcanic island of the Northern
Sea, the old Danish language was preserved unchanged
for centuries; while, in the various <a id='tn305a'></a>Eddas, were embodied
those folk-songs and folk-myths, and, in the sagas, those
historical tales and legends of an age at once heroic and
romantic, together with that folk-lore which still forms
the staple of all our old favourite nursery tales, as
brought with them from Europe and the East by the
first settlers.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a> All these, as well as the productions of
the Icelanders themselves, are of great historical and
literary value. They have been carefully edited and
published, at Copenhagen, by eminent Icelandic, Danish,
and other antiquarians. We would refer to the writings
of Müller, Magnusen, Rafn, Rask, Eyricksson, Torfæus,
and others. Laing has translated “The Heimskringla,”
the great historical Saga of Snorro Sturleson, into
English.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Various other translations and accounts of
these singularly interesting <a id='tn305b'></a>Eddas, sagas, and ballads,
handed down by the scalds and Sagamen, are to be met
with; but by far the best analysis, with translated specimens,
is that contained in Howitt’s “Literature and
Romance of Northern Europe.”<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a> We would call attention,
in passing, to that Edda, consisting of the original
series of tragic poems from which the German “Niebelungen-lied”
has been derived. Considered as a series of
fragments, it is a marvellous production, and, to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>thinking, absolutely unparalleled in ancient or modern
literature, for power, simplicity, and heroic grandeur.</p>

<p class='c011'>Christianity was established in Iceland in the year
1000. Fifty-seven years later, Isleif, Bishop of <a id='tn306'></a>Skálholt,
first introduced the art of writing the Roman alphabet,
thus enabling them to fix oral lessons of history and
song; for, the Runic characters previously in use were
chiefly employed for monuments and memorial inscriptions,
and were carved on wood staves, on stone or metal.
On analysis, these rude letters will be found to be crude
forms and abridgments of the Greek or Roman alphabet.
We have identified them all, with the exception of a few
letters, and are quite satisfied on this point, so simple
and obvious is it, although we have not previously had
our attention directed to the fact.</p>

<p class='c011'>Snorro Sturleson was perhaps one of the most learned
and remarkable men that Iceland has produced.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1264, through fear and fraud, the island submitted
to the rule of Haco, king of Norway:—he who died at
Kirkwall, after his forces were routed by the Scots at the
battle of Largs. In 1387, along with Norway, it became
subject to Denmark. In 1529, a printing press
was established; and in 1550 the Lutheran reformation
was introduced into the island—which form of worship
is still retained.</p>

<p class='c011'>True to the instinct of race, the early settlers in Iceland
did not remain inactive, but looked westward, and
found scope for their hereditary maritime skill in the
discovery and colonising of Greenland. They also discovered
Helluland (Newfoundland), Markland (Nova
Scotia), and Vineland (New England). They were also
acquainted with American land, which they called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Hvitramannaland, (the land of the white men), thought
to have been North and South Carolina, Georgia, and
Florida. We have read authentic records of these
various voyages, extending from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 877 to <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1347.
The names of the principal navigators are Gunnbiorn,
Eric the Red, <a id='tn307'></a>Biarni, Leif, Thorwald, &#38;c. But the
most distinguished of these American discoverers is
Thorfinn Karlsefne, an Icelander, “whose genealogy,”
says Rafn, “is carried back, in the old northern annals,
to Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Scottish, and Irish ancestors,
some of them of royal blood.” With singular
interest we also read that, “in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1266, some priests at
Gardar, in Greenland, set on foot a voyage of discovery
to the arctic regions of America. An astronomical observation
proves that this took place through Lancaster
Sound and Barrow’s Strait to the latitude of Wellington’s
Channel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Columbus visited Iceland in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1467, he may
have obtained confirmation of his theories as to the
existence of a great continent in the west; for, these
authentic records prove the discovery and colonisation of
America, by the Northmen from Iceland, upwards of five
hundred years before he re-discovered it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Norman outgoing is the last to which we shall
here allude. In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 876 the Northmen, under Rollo,
wrested Normandy from the Franks; and from thence,
in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1065, William, sprung from the same stock,
landed at Hastings, vanquished Harold, and to this day
is known as the Conqueror of England. It was a contest
of Northmen with Northmen, where diamond cut diamond.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of a chapter, this subject, we feel, would require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>a volume. At the outset we asserted that northern
subjects possessed singular interest for the British
race. In a very cursory manner we have endeavoured to
prove it, by shewing that to Scandinavia, as its cradle,
we must look for the germs of that spirit of enterprise
which has peopled America, raised an Indian empire,
and colonised Australia, and which has bound together,
as one, dominions on which the sun never sets; all, too,
either speaking, or fast acquiring, a noble language,
which bids fair one day to become universal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The various germs, tendencies, and traits of Scandinavian
character, knit together and amalgamated in the
British race, go to form the essential elements of greatness
and success, and, where sanctified and directed into
right channels, are noble materials to work upon.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is Britain’s pride to be at once the mistress of the
seas, the home of freedom, and the sanctuary of the
oppressed. May it also be her high honour, by wisely
improving outward privileges, and yet further developing
her inborn capabilities, pre-eminently to become the
torch-bearer of pure Christianity—with its ever-accompanying
freedom and civilisation—to the whole world!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Since our visit, there has been another eruption of Kötlugjá in
1860, the particulars of which have been collected by Lauder Lindsay,
Esq. M.D., F.L.S. &#38;c., and published in the Edinburgh “Philosophical
Journal” for January. From his interesting and admirable scientific
paper, which treats the subject largely, we learn that this eruption,
like that of 1823, was “mild and innocuous.” It began on the 8th, and
continued to the 28th or 29th of May, and was preceded for several
days by earthquakes. On the morning of the eighth a dark cloud was
seen to rise from the mountain, which at the same moment sent forth
an enormous flood of water, with very large pieces of ice, running with
the water-stream into the sea. Some of the pieces of ice were so large
that they were stranded at a twenty fathom depth in the sea. On the
12th of May the flames could be seen from Reykjavik, although this
town is no less than about eighty English miles distant. During the
evenings flashes of lightning were seen in the same direction. On the
16th May, the smoke was about twenty-four thousand (?) feet high; it
was sometimes of a dark colour, but at other times it resembled steam.
At this time the fire was seen from several places at a distance of
about 80 English miles. The wind being northerly during the eruption,
the sand and ashes fell chiefly in Myrdals-sand, which was the
direction also taken by the <a id='tn164'></a>water-floods. Sulphur was found floating
in the sea, and the fish disappeared from certain parts of the neighbouring
coasts. A large quantity of cinders was mixed with the water-floods.
Cinders and balls of fire, as well as smoke, were thrown up;
but the cinders and ashes, from being carried by the wind partly into
the sea and partly to the neighbouring snow-fields, did comparatively
little damage to the lowland farms; although the well-known devastations
of former eruptions, especially those of 1665 and 1755, gave rise
to extreme alarm and the most serious apprehensions among the poor
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='label'><a href='#r42'>42</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Sæmund Frodi, like other learned men of those days, was supposed
to be in possession of magic powers. He was the Friar Bacon of
Iceland; and these stories in which his name figures, handed down
by tradition, are still often told in Iceland by the fireside on the long
winter evenings. Curious to observe, that, in most mediæval stories
of this kind, Satan is always outwitted and gets the worst of it. <span class='fss'>A.J.S.</span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c011'><span class='label'><a href='#r43'>43</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This story may explain the origin of the Scotch proverb, “Deil
tak’ the hindmost.”—There is another version of Sæmund’s mode
of escape; viz.: That when he was about to be seized, pointing to
his shadow on the wall, he said, “I am not the hindmost, <a id='tn221a'></a>don’t you
see him that is coming behind me!” Old Nick then caught at the
shadow, and thought it was a man; but Sæmund got out, and the
door was slammed on his heels. But after that time, it is added,
Sæmund was always without a shadow, for Old Nick would not let
his shadow free again. Here, in this old-world story, we have the
germ of Chamisso’s “Shadowless Man.” <span class='fss'>A.J.S.</span></p>

must be remembered that a superstition prevailed amongst the
Icelanders regarding the central deserts. These, they believed, were
inhabited by a strange mysterious race of men who held no
intercourse with the other inhabitants, and were said to be in the
habit of kidnapping women from the country. This belief may have
had its origin in the fact, that, in former days, some few outlaws and
their families took refuge in the deserts, and lived there for a time in
order to escape the hands of justice. <span class='fss'><a id='tn226'></a>A.J.S.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='label'><a href='#r52'>52</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The raven was regarded as sacred, and greatly venerated by the old
Norse Vikings, who had always one or two of these birds in their ships.
When setting out on marauding expeditions the raven was let loose and
his flight followed by the bold voyagers, in the belief that he led them to
war and victory. These birds it was supposed lived to a fabulous age.
Odin’s shield had a raven on it, and so had the <i>Landeyda</i> or battle-flag of
Sigurd, which ever led to victory, although its bearer was doomed to die.
<a id='tn281b'></a>Hialtland is the ancient name of Shetland. The Norse rovers thought it
a disgrace to die in their beds in peace; and when they found their end
approaching, clad in armour, had themselves carried on board their
ships which were then set fire to and sent adrift, that the old heroes
might die, as they had lived, on the ocean, and thence worthily rise to
Valhalla.</p>
